CHAPTER
I.
WHICH
TREATS
OF
 THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA
MANCHA In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire
to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen
that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and
a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a
salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a
pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his
income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet
breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a
brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper
past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and
market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the
bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty;
he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and
a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or
Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the
authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable
conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however,
is of but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to
stray a hair's breadth from the truth in the telling of it. You must
know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at leisure
(which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading books
of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely
neglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of
his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go
that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to
read, and brought home as many of them as he could get. But of all
there were none he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de
Silva's composition, for their lucidity of style and complicated
conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in his reading
he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often found passages
like "the reason of the unreason with which my reason is afflicted so
weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty;" or again,
"the high heavens, that of your divinity divinely fortify you with the
stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness deserves."
Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and used
to lie awake striving to understand them and worm the meaning out of
them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out or extracted had
he come to life again for that special purpose. He was not at all easy
about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because it seemed
to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must
have had his face and body covered all over with seams and scars. He
commended, however, the author's way of ending his book with the
promise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was he tempted
to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which
no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it
too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented him. Many
an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned man,
and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight,
Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village
barber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the
Knight of Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with
him it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a
spirit that was equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight,
nor lachrymose like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was
not a whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books
that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from
dawn to dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much
reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew
full of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments,
quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and
all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that
the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to
him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used to say the
Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be
compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke
cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more of
Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of
enchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he
strangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of
the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is
always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and
well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially
when he saw him sallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he
met, and when beyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as
his history says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at
that traitor of a Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his
niece into the bargain. In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit
upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this world hit upon, and
that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the
support of his own honour as for the service of his country, that he
should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over in full
armour and on horseback in quest of adventures, and putting in
practice himself all that he had read of as being the usual practices
of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself
to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he was to reap eternal
renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might
of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by the
intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himself
forthwith to put his scheme into execution. The first thing he did was
to make Don Quixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight
chamois suit we have already described and depicted more than once,
out on a balcony overhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in
full view of the crowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would
at a monkey. The cavaliers in livery careered before him again as
though it were for him alone, and not to enliven the festival of the
day, that they wore it, and Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed
to him that, how he knew not, he had fallen upon another Camacho's
wedding, another house like Don Diego de Miranda's, another castle
like the duke's. Some of Don Antonio's friends dined with him that
day, and all showed honour to Don Quixote and treated him as a
knight-errant, and he becoming puffed up and exalted in consequence
could not contain himself for satisfaction. Such were the drolleries
of Sancho that all the servants of the house, and all who heard him,
were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table Don Antonio said to
him, "We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond of manjar blanco
and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you keep them in
your bosom for the next day." "No, senor, that's not true," said
Sancho, "for I am more cleanly than greedy, and my master Don Quixote
here knows well that we two are used to live for a week on a handful
of acorns or nuts. To be sure, if it so happens that they offer me a
heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I eat what I'm given, and make
use of opportunities as I find them; but whoever says that I'm an
out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me tell him that he is wrong;
and I'd put it in a different way if I did not respect the honourable
beards that are at the table." "Indeed," said Don Quixote, "Sancho's
moderation and cleanliness in eating might be inscribed and graved on
plates of brass, to be kept in eternal remembrance in ages to come. It
is true that when he is hungry there is a certain appearance of
voracity about him, for he eats at a great pace and chews with both
jaws; but cleanliness he is always mindful of; and when he was
governor he learned how to eat daintily, so much so that he eats
grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork." "What!" said Don
Antonio, "has Sancho been a governor?" "Ay," said Sancho, "and of an
island called Barataria. I governed it to perfection for ten days; and
lost my rest all the time; and learned to look down upon all the
governments in the world; I got out of it by taking to flight, and
fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead, and out of which I
escaped alive by a miracle." Don Quixote then gave them a minute
account of the whole affair of Sancho's government, with which he
greatly amused his hearers. On the cloth being removed Don Antonio,
taking Don Quixote by the hand, passed with him into a distant room in
which there was nothing in the way of furniture except a table,
apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestal of the same, upon which
was set up, after the fashion of the busts of the Roman emperors, a
head which seemed to be of bronze. Don Antonio traversed the whole
apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table several times,
and then said, "Now, Senor Don Quixote, that I am satisfied that no
one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I will tell you of
one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking strange
things, that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep what I
say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy." "I swear it," said
Don Quixote, "and for greater security I will put a flag-stone over
it; for I would have you know, Senor Don Antonio" (he had by this time
learned his name), "that you are addressing one who, though he has
ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may safely transfer
whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely upon it that you
have consigned it to the depths of silence." "In reliance upon that
promise," said Don Antonio, "I will astonish you with what you shall
see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the vexation it gives me
to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets, for they are not of a
sort to be entrusted to everybody." Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering
what could be the object of such precautions; whereupon Don Antonio
taking his hand passed it over the bronze head and the whole table and
the pedestal of jasper on which it stood, and then said, "This head,
Senor Don Quixote, has been made and fabricated by one of the greatest
magicians and wizards the world ever saw, a Pole, I believe, by birth,
and a pupil of the famous Escotillo of whom such marvellous stories
are told. He was here in my house, and for a consideration of a
thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed this head, which has
the property and virtue of answering whatever questions are put to its
ear. He observed the points of the compass, he traced figures, he
studied the stars, he watched favourable moments, and at length
brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for on Fridays it
is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next day. In the
interval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it; and
I know by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth." Don
Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was
inclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he
had to wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything
except that he thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a
secret. They then quitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and
they repaired to the chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were
assembled. In the meantime Sancho had recounted to them several of the
adventures and accidents that had happened his master. That afternoon
they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour but in
street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at that
season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left with the
servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the house. Don
Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy
pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on
the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on
which they wrote in large letters, "This is Don Quixote of La Mancha."
As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of
all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, "This is Don Quixote
of La Mancha," Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at
him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don
Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, "Great are the
privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it
known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even
the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me."
"True, Senor Don Quixote," returned Don Antonio; "for as fire cannot
be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and
that which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished
above all others." It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was
proceeding amid the acclamations that have been described, a
Castilian, reading the inscription on his back, cried out in a loud
voice, "The devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art
thou here, and not dead of the countless drubbings that have fallen on
thy ribs? Thou art mad; and if thou wert so by thyself, and kept
thyself within thy madness, it would not be so bad; but thou hast the
gift of making fools and blockheads of all who have anything to do
with thee or say to thee. Why, look at these gentlemen bearing thee
company! Get thee home, blockhead, and see after thy affairs, and thy
wife and children, and give over these fooleries that are sapping thy
brains and skimming away thy wits." "Go your own way, brother," said
Don Antonio, "and don't offer advice to those who don't ask you for
it. Senor Don Quixote is in his full senses, and we who bear him
company are not fools; virtue is to be honoured wherever it may be
found; go, and bad luck to you, and don't meddle where you are not
wanted." "By God, your worship is right," replied the Castilian; "for
to advise this good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all
that it fills me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead
has in everything should dribble away by the channel of his
knight-errantry; but may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me
and all my descendants, if, from this day forth, though I should live
longer than Methuselah, I ever give advice to anybody even if he asks
me for it." The advice-giver took himself off, and they continued
their stroll; but so great was the press of the boys and people to
read the placard, that Don Antonio was forced to remove it as if he
were taking off something else. Night came and they went home, and
there was a ladies' dancing party, for Don Antonio's wife, a lady of
rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, had invited some friends of hers to
come and do honour to her guest and amuse themselves with his strange
delusions. Several of them came, they supped sumptuously, the dance
began at about ten o'clock. Among the ladies were two of a mischievous
and frolicsome turn, and, though perfectly modest, somewhat free in
playing tricks for harmless diversion sake. These two were so
indefatigable in taking Don Quixote out to dance that they tired him
down, not only in body but in spirit. It was a sight to see the figure
Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, his garments clinging
tight to him, ungainly, and above all anything but agile. The gay
ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly repelled
them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he
lifted up his voice and exclaimed, "Fugite, partes adversae! Leave me
in peace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies, for
she who is queen of mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers
none but hers to lead me captive and subdue me;" and so saying he sat
down on the floor in the middle of the room, tired out and broken down
by all this exertion in the dance. Don Antonio directed him to be
taken up bodily and carried to bed, and the first that laid hold of
him was Sancho, saying as he did so, "In an evil hour you took to
dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men of valour are
dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? If you do, I can
tell you you are mistaken; there's many a man would rather undertake
to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been the shoe-fling you
were at I could take your place, for I can do the shoe-fling like a
gerfalcon; but I'm no good at dancing." With these and other
observations Sancho set the whole ball-room laughing, and then put his
master to bed, covering him up well so that he might sweat out any
chill caught after his dancing. The next day Don Antonio thought he
might as well make trial of the enchanted head, and with Don Quixote,
Sancho, and two others, friends of his, besides the two ladies that
had tired out Don Quixote at the ball, who had remained for the night
with Don Antonio's wife, he locked himself up in the chamber where the
head was. He explained to them the property it possessed and entrusted
the secret to them, telling them that now for the first time he was
going to try the virtue of the enchanted head; but except Don
Antonio's two friends no one else was privy to the mystery of the
enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not first revealed it to them they
would have been inevitably reduced to the same state of amazement as
the rest, so artfully and skilfully was it contrived. The first to
approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and in a low
voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said to it,
"Head, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at this
moment thinking of?" The head, without any movement of the lips,
answered in a clear and distinct voice, so as to be heard by all, "I
cannot judge of thoughts." All were thunderstruck at this, and all the
more so as they saw that there was nobody anywhere near the table or
in the whole room that could have answered. "How many of us are here?"
asked Don Antonio once more; and it was answered him in the same way
softly, "Thou and thy wife, with two friends of thine and two of hers,
and a famous knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of
his, Sancho Panza by name." Now there was fresh astonishment; now
everyone's hair was standing on end with awe; and Don Antonio retiring
from the head exclaimed, "This suffices to show me that I have not
been deceived by him who sold thee to me, O sage head, talking head,
answering head, wonderful head! Let some one else go and put what
question he likes to it." And as women are commonly impulsive and
inquisitive, the first to come forward was one of the two friends of
Don Antonio's wife, and her question was, "Tell me, Head, what shall I
do to be very beautiful?" and the answer she got was, "Be very
modest." "I question thee no further," said the fair querist. Her
companion then came up and said, "I should like to know, Head, whether
my husband loves me or not;" the answer given to her was, "Think how
he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;" and the married lady went off
saying, "That answer did not need a question; for of course the
treatment one receives shows the disposition of him from whom it is
received." Then one of Don Antonio's two friends advanced and asked
it, "Who am I?" "Thou knowest," was the answer. "That is not what I
ask thee," said the gentleman, "but to tell me if thou knowest me."
"Yes, I know thee, thou art Don Pedro Noriz," was the reply. "I do not
seek to know more," said the gentleman, "for this is enough to
convince me, O Head, that thou knowest everything;" and as he retired
the other friend came forward and asked it, "Tell me, Head, what are
the wishes of my eldest son?" "I have said already," was the answer,
"that I cannot judge of wishes; however, I can tell thee the wish of
thy son is to bury thee." "That's 'what I see with my eyes I point out
with my finger,'" said the gentleman, "so I ask no more." Don
Antonio's wife came up and said, "I know not what to ask thee, Head; I
would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many years of
enjoyment of my good husband;" and the answer she received was, "Thou
shalt, for his vigour and his temperate habits promise many years of
life, which by their intemperance others so often cut short." Then Don
Quixote came forward and said, "Tell me, thou that answerest, was that
which I describe as having happened to me in the cave of Montesinos
the truth or a dream? Will Sancho's whipping be accomplished without
fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be brought about?" "As to
the question of the cave," was the reply, "there is much to be said;
there is something of both in it. Sancho's whipping will proceed
leisurely. The disenchantment of Dulcinea will attain its due
consummation." "I seek to know no more," said Don Quixote; "let me but
see Dulcinea disenchanted, and I will consider that all the good
fortune I could wish for has come upon me all at once." The last
questioner was Sancho, and his questions were, "Head, shall I by any
chance have another government? Shall I ever escape from the hard life
of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?" To which
the answer came, "Thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou
returnest to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing
to serve thou shalt cease to be a squire." "Good, by God!" said Sancho
Panza; "I could have told myself that; the prophet Perogrullo could
have said no more." "What answer wouldst thou have, beast?" said Don
Quixote; "is it not enough that the replies this head has given suit
the questions put to it?" "Yes, it is enough," said Sancho; "but I
should have liked it to have made itself plainer and told me more."
The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with
which all were filled, except Don Antonio's two friends who were in
the secret. This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once,
not to keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some
strange magical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model
of another head, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at
Madrid, Don Antonio made this one at home for his own amusement and to
astonish ignorant people; and its mechanism was as follows. The table
was of wood painted and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal
on which it stood was of the same material, with four eagles' claws
projecting from it to support the weight more steadily. The head,
which resembled a bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured
like bronze, was hollow throughout, as was the table, into which it
was fitted so exactly that no trace of the joining was visible. The
pedestal of the table was also hollow and communicated with the throat
and neck of the head, and the whole was in communication with another
room underneath the chamber in which the head stood. Through the
entire cavity in the pedestal, table, throat and neck of the bust or
figure, there passed a tube of tin carefully adjusted and concealed
from sight. In the room below corresponding to the one above was
placed the person who was to answer, with his mouth to the tube, and
the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passed from above downwards, and from
below upwards, the words coming clearly and distinctly; it was
impossible, thus, to detect the trick. A nephew of Don Antonio's, a
smart sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as he had been told
beforehand by his uncle who the persons were that would come with him
that day into the chamber where the head was, it was an easy matter
for him to answer the first question at once and correctly; the others
he answered by guess-work, and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete
adds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve
days; but that, as it became noised abroad through the city that he
had in his house an enchanted head that answered all who asked
questions of it, Don Antonio, fearing it might come to the ears of the
watchful sentinels of our faith, explained the matter to the
inquisitors, who commanded him to break it up and have done with it,
lest the ignorant vulgar should be scandalised. By Don Quixote,
however, and by Sancho the head was still held to be an enchanted one,
and capable of answering questions, though more to Don Quixote's
satisfaction than Sancho's. The gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don
Antonio and also to do the honours to Don Quixote, and give him an
opportunity of displaying his folly, made arrangements for a tilting
at the ring in six days from that time, which, however, for reason
that will be mentioned hereafter, did not take place. Don Quixote took
a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot, for he feared
that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him; so he and
Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out for a walk.
Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don Quixote
lifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over a door,
"Books printed here," at which he was vastly pleased, for until then
he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to know what
it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them drawing
sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type here,
revising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great
printing offices. He went up to one case and asked what they were
about there; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and
passed on. He approached one man, among others, and asked him what he
was doing. The workman replied, "Senor, this gentleman here" (pointing
to a man of prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look)
"has translated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am
setting it up in type for the press." "What is the title of the book?"
asked Don Quixote; to which the author replied, "Senor, in Italian the
book is called Le Bagatelle." "And what does Le Bagatelle import in
our Spanish?" asked Don Quixote. "Le Bagatelle," said the author, "is
as though we should say in Spanish Los Juguetes; but though the book
is humble in name it has good solid matter in it." "I," said Don
Quixote, "have some little smattering of Italian, and I plume myself
on singing some of Ariosto's stanzas; but tell me, senor--I do not say
this to test your ability, but merely out of curiosity--have you ever
met with the word pignatta in your book?" "Yes, often," said the
author. "And how do you render that in Spanish?" "How should I render
it," returned the author, "but by olla?" "Body o' me," exclaimed Don
Quixote, "what a proficient you are in the Italian language! I would
lay a good wager that where they say in Italian piace you say in
Spanish place, and where they say piu you say mas, and you translate
su by arriba and giu by abajo." "I translate them so of course," said
the author, "for those are their proper equivalents." "I would venture
to swear," said Don Quixote, "that your worship is not known in the
world, which always begrudges their reward to rare wits and
praiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! What genius
thrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seems to
me that translation from one language into another, if it be not from
the queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at
Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are
visible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they
do not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side; and
translation from easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command
of words, any more than transcribing or copying out one document from
another. But I do not mean by this to draw the inference that no
credit is to be allowed for the work of translating, for a man may
employ himself in ways worse and less profitable to himself. This
estimate does not include two famous translators, Doctor Cristobal de
Figueroa, in his Pastor Fido, and Don Juan de Jauregui, in his Aminta,
wherein by their felicity they leave it in doubt which is the
translation and which the original. But tell me, are you printing this
book at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright to some
bookseller?" "I print at my own risk," said the author, "and I expect
to make a thousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to
be of two thousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals
apiece." "A fine calculation you are making!" said Don Quixote; "it is
plain you don't know the ins and outs of the printers, and how they
play into one another's hands. I promise you when you find yourself
saddled with two thousand copies you will feel so sore that it will
astonish you, particularly if the book is a little out of the common
and not in any way highly spiced." "What!" said the author, "would
your worship, then, have me give it to a bookseller who will give
three maravedis for the copyright and think he is doing me a favour? I
do not print my books to win fame in the world, for I am known in it
already by my works; I want to make money, without which reputation is
not worth a rap." "God send your worship good luck," said Don Quixote;
and he moved on to another case, where he saw them correcting a sheet
of a book with the title of "Light of the Soul;" noticing it he
observed, "Books like this, though there are many of the kind, are the
ones that deserve to be printed, for many are the sinners in these
days, and lights unnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness."
He passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and when
he asked its title they told him it was called, "The Second Part of
the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha," by one of
Tordesillas. "I have heard of this book already," said Don Quixote,
"and verily and on my conscience I thought it had been by this time
burned to ashes as a meddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come
to it as it does to every pig; for fictions have the more merit and
charm about them the more nearly they approach the truth or what looks
like it; and true stories, the truer they are the better they are;"
and so saying he walked out of the printing office with a certain
amount of displeasure in his looks. That same day Don Antonio arranged
to take him to see the galleys that lay at the beach, whereat Sancho
was in high delight, as he had never seen any all his life. Don
Antonio sent word to the commandant of the galleys that he intended to
bring his guest, the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the
knight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, and was,
he assured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that in
four days from that date, that is to say, on Saint John the Baptist's
Day, he was going to deposit him in full armour mounted on his horse
Rocinante, together with his squire Sancho on an ass, in the middle of
the strand of the city; and bidding him give notice of this to his
friends the Niarros, that they might divert themselves with him. He
wished, he said, his enemies the Cadells could be deprived of this
pleasure; but that was impossible, because the crazes and shrewd
sayings of Don Quixote and the humours of his squire Sancho Panza
could not help giving general pleasure to all the world. He despatched
the letter by one of his squires, who, exchanging the costume of a
highwayman for that of a peasant, made his way into Barcelona and gave
it to the person to whom it was directed. CHAPTER LXI. OF WHAT
HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON ENTERING BARCELONA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER
MATTERS THAT PARTAKE OF THE TRUE RATHER THAN OF THE INGENIOUS Don
Quixote passed three days and three nights with Roque, and had he
passed three hundred years he would have found enough to observe and
wonder at in his mode of life. At daybreak they were in one spot, at
dinner-time in another; sometimes they fled without knowing from whom,
at other times they lay in wait, not knowing for what. They slept
standing, breaking their slumbers to shift from place to place. There
was nothing but sending out spies and scouts, posting sentinels and
blowing the matches of harquebusses, though they carried but few, for
almost all used flintlocks. Roque passed his nights in some place or
other apart from his men, that they might not know where he was, for
the many proclamations the viceroy of Barcelona had issued against his
life kept him in fear and uneasiness, and he did not venture to trust
anyone, afraid that even his own men would kill him or deliver him up
to the authorities; of a truth, a weary miserable life! At length, by
unfrequented roads, short cuts, and secret paths, Roque, Don Quixote,
and Sancho, together with six squires, set out for Barcelona. They
reached the strand on Saint John's Eve during the night; and Roque,
after embracing Don Quixote and Sancho (to whom he presented the ten
crowns he had promised but had not until then given), left them with
many expressions of good-will on both sides. Roque went back, while
Don Quixote remained on horseback, just as he was, waiting for day,
and it was not long before the countenance of the fair Aurora began to
show itself at the balconies of the east, gladdening the grass and
flowers, if not the ear, though to gladden that too there came at the
same moment a sound of clarions and drums, and a din of bells, and a
tramp, tramp, and cries of "Clear the way there!" of some runners,
that seemed to issue from the city. The dawn made way for the sun that
with a face broader than a buckler began to rise slowly above the low
line of the horizon; Don Quixote and Sancho gazed all round them; they
beheld the sea, a sight until then unseen by them; it struck them as
exceedingly spacious and broad, much more so than the lakes of Ruidera
which they had seen in La Mancha. They saw the galleys along the
beach, which, lowering their awnings, displayed themselves decked with
streamers and pennons that trembled in the breeze and kissed and swept
the water, while on board the bugles, trumpets, and clarions were
sounding and filling the air far and near with melodious warlike
notes. Then they began to move and execute a kind of skirmish upon the
calm water, while a vast number of horsemen on fine horses and in
showy liveries, issuing from the city, engaged on their side in a
somewhat similar movement. The soldiers on board the galleys kept up a
ceaseless fire, which they on the walls and forts of the city
returned, and the heavy cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise
they made, to which the gangway guns of the galleys replied. The
bright sea, the smiling earth, the clear air--though at times darkened
by the smoke of the guns--all seemed to fill the whole multitude with
unexpected delight. Sancho could not make out how it was that those
great masses that moved over the sea had so many feet. And now the
horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and outlandish cries
and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed and wondering; and one of
them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressing him exclaimed,
"Welcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure of all
knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiant Don
Quixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal,
that these latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the
true, the legitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower
of historians, has described to us!" Don Quixote made no answer, nor
did the horsemen wait for one, but wheeling again with all their
followers, they began curvetting round Don Quixote, who, turning to
Sancho, said, "These gentlemen have plainly recognised us; I will
wager they have read our history, and even that newly printed one by
the Aragonese." The cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again
approached him and said, "Come with us, Senor Don Quixote, for we are
all of us your servants and great friends of Roque Guinart's;" to
which Don Quixote returned, "If courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir
knight, is daughter or very nearly akin to the great Roque's; carry me
where you please; I will have no will but yours, especially if you
deign to employ it in your service." The cavalier replied with words
no less polite, and then, all closing in around him, they set out with
him for the city, to the music of the clarions and the drums. As they
were entering it, the wicked one, who is the author of all mischief,
and the boys who are wickeder than the wicked one, contrived that a
couple of these audacious irrepressible urchins should force their way
through the crowd, and lifting up, one of them Dapple's tail and the
other Rocinante's, insert a bunch of furze under each. The poor beasts
felt the strange spurs and added to their anguish by pressing their
tails tight, so much so that, cutting a multitude of capers, they
flung their masters to the ground. Don Quixote, covered with shame and
out of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from his poor jade's tail,
while Sancho did the same for Dapple. His conductors tried to punish
the audacity of the boys, but there was no possibility of doing so,
for they hid themselves among the hundreds of others that were
following them. Don Quixote and Sancho mounted once more, and with the
same music and acclamations reached their conductor's house, which was
large and stately, that of a rich gentleman, in short; and there for
the present we will leave them, for such is Cide Hamete's pleasure.
CHAPTER LXII. WHICH DEALS WITH THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED HEAD,
TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRIVIAL MATTERS WHICH CANNOT BE LEFT UNTOLD Don
Quixote's host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentleman of
wealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any
fair and good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his house he set
about devising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some
harmless fashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport
is worth anything if it hurts another. The first thing he did was to
make Don Quixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight
chamois suit we have already described and depicted more than once,
out on a balcony overhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in
full view of the crowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would
at a monkey. The cavaliers in livery careered before him again as
though it were for him alone, and not to enliven the festival of the
day, that they wore it, and Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed
to him that, how he knew not, he had fallen upon another Camacho's
wedding, another house like Don Diego de Miranda's, another castle
like the duke's. Some of Don Antonio's friends dined with him that
day, and all showed honour to Don Quixote and treated him as a
knight-errant, and he becoming puffed up and exalted in consequence
could not contain himself for satisfaction. Such were the drolleries
of Sancho that all the servants of the house, and all who heard him,
were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table Don Antonio said to
him, "We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond of manjar blanco
and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you keep them in
your bosom for the next day." "No, senor, that's not true," said
Sancho, "for I am more cleanly than greedy, and my master Don Quixote
here knows well that we two are used to live for a week on a handful
of acorns or nuts. To be sure, if it so happens that they offer me a
heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I eat what I'm given, and make
use of opportunities as I find them; but whoever says that I'm an
out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me tell him that he is wrong;
and I'd put it in a different way if I did not respect the honourable
beards that are at the table." "Indeed," said Don Quixote, "Sancho's
moderation and cleanliness in eating might be inscribed and graved on
plates of brass, to be kept in eternal remembrance in ages to come. It
is true that when he is hungry there is a certain appearance of
voracity about him, for he eats at a great pace and chews with both
jaws; but cleanliness he is always mindful of; and when he was
governor he learned how to eat daintily, so much so that he eats
grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork." "What!" said Don
Antonio, "has Sancho been a governor?" "Ay," said Sancho, "and of an
island called Barataria. I governed it to perfection for ten days; and
lost my rest all the time; and learned to look down upon all the
governments in the world; I got out of it by taking to flight, and
fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead, and out of which I
escaped alive by a miracle." Don Quixote then gave them a minute
account of the whole affair of Sancho's government, with which he
greatly amused his hearers. On the cloth being removed Don Antonio,
taking Don Quixote by the hand, passed with him into a distant room in
which there was nothing in the way of furniture except a table,
apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestal of the same, upon which
was set up, after the fashion of the busts of the Roman emperors, a
head which seemed to be of bronze. Don Antonio traversed the whole
apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table several times,
and then said, "Now, Senor Don Quixote, that I am satisfied that no
one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I will tell you of
one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking strange
things, that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep what I
say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy." "I swear it," said
Don Quixote, "and for greater security I will put a flag-stone over
it; for I would have you know, Senor Don Antonio" (he had by this time
learned his name), "that you are addressing one who, though he has
ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may safely transfer
whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely upon it that you
have consigned it to the depths of silence." "In reliance upon that
promise," said Don Antonio, "I will astonish you with what you shall
see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the vexation it gives me
to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets, for they are not of a
sort to be entrusted to everybody." Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering
what could be the object of such precautions; whereupon Don Antonio
taking his hand passed it over the bronze head and the whole table and
the pedestal of jasper on which it stood, and then said, "This head,
Senor Don Quixote, has been made and fabricated by one of the greatest
magicians and wizards the world ever saw, a Pole, I believe, by birth,
and a pupil of the famous Escotillo of whom such marvellous stories
are told. He was here in my house, and for a consideration of a
thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed this head, which has
the property and virtue of answering whatever questions are put to its
ear. He observed the points of the compass, he traced figures, he
studied the stars, he watched favourable moments, and at length
brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for on Fridays it
is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next day. In the
interval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it; and
I know by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth." Don
Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was
inclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he
had to wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything
except that he thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a
secret. They then quitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and
they repaired to the chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were
assembled. In the meantime Sancho had recounted to them several of the
adventures and accidents that had happened his master. That afternoon
they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour but in
street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at that
season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left with the
servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the house. Don
Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy
pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on
the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on
which they wrote in large letters, "This is Don Quixote of La Mancha."
As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of
all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, "This is Don Quixote
of La Mancha," Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at
him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don
Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, "Great are the
privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it
known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even
the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me."
"True, Senor Don Quixote," returned Don Antonio; "for as fire cannot
be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and
that which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished
above all others." It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was
proceeding amid the acclamations that have been described, a
Castilian, reading the inscription on his back, cried out in a loud
voice, "The devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art
thou here, and not dead of the countless drubbings that have fallen on
thy ribs? Thou art mad; and if thou wert so by thyself, and kept
thyself within thy madness, it would not be so bad; but I am beginning
to think that all the plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to
put us right." "No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness,
Sancho, as I mean to do," returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how
Rocinante is, for it seems to me that not the least share of this
mishap has fallen to the lot of the poor beast." "There is nothing
wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a knight-errant too;
what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot-free where
we come out scotched." "Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity
in order to bring relief to it," said Don Quixote; "I say so because
this little beast may now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me
hence to some castle where I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I
shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted, for I remember
having read how the good old Silenus, the tutor and instructor of the
gay god of laughter, when he entered the city of the hundred gates,
went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass." "It may be true that
he went mounted as your worship says," answered Sancho, "but there is
a great difference between going mounted and going slung like a sack
of manure." To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle
confer honour instead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no
more, but, as I told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put
me on top of thy beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let
us go hence ere night come on and surprise us in these wilds." "And
yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is very
meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they
esteem it very good fortune." "That is," said Don Quixote, "when they
cannot help it, or when they are in love; and so true is this that
there have been knights who have remained two years on rocks, in
sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven, without their
ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was Amadis, when,
under the name of Beltenebros, he took up his abode on the Pena Pobre
for--I know not if it was eight years or eight months, for I am not
very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he stayed there doing penance
for I know not what pique the Princess Oriana had against him; but no
more of this now, Sancho, and make haste before a mishap like
Rocinante's befalls the ass." "The very devil would be in it in that
case," said Sancho; and letting off thirty "ohs," and sixty sighs, and
a hundred and twenty maledictions and execrations on whomsoever it was
that had brought him there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent
like a Turkish bow without power to bring himself upright, but with
all his pains he saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat,
yielding to the excessive licence of the day; he next raised up
Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a tongue to complain with,
most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master would have been behind
him. To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured
Rocinante with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he
proceeded more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the
high road might be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for
them from good to better, he had not gone a short league when the road
came in sight, and on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance
and to the delight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho
insisted that it was an inn, and his master that it was not one, but a
castle, and the dispute lasted so long that before the point was
settled they had time to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all
his team without any further controversy. CHAPTER XVI. OF WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO BE A
CASTLE The innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked
Sancho what was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing,
only that he had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little
bruised. The innkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as
those of her calling commonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted
and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set
about tending Don Quixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely
girl, help her in taking care of her guest. There was besides in the
inn, as servant, an Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and
snub nose, blind of one eye and not very sound in the other. The
elegance of her shape, to be sure, made up for all her defects; she
did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and her shoulders,
which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the ground more
than she liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and
the two made up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed
evident signs of having formerly served for many years as a
straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a carrier whose bed was
placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and, though only made of the
pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the advantage of it, as
Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not very
even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a
quilt, full of pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to
be wool, would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two
sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet the threads of which
anyone that chose might have counted without missing one in the
reckoning. On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the
hostess and her daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to
toe, while Maritornes--for that was the name of the Asturian--held the
light for them, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how
full of wheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had
more the look of blows than of a fall. It was not blows, Sancho said,
but that the rock had many points and projections, and that each of
them had left its mark. "Pray, senora," he added, "manage to save some
tow, as there will be no want of some one to use it, for my loins too
are rather sore." "Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess.
"I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at
seeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a
thousand thwacks." "That may well be," said the young girl, "for it
has many a time happened to me to dream that I was falling down from a
tower and never coming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream
to find myself as weak and shaken as if I had really fallen." "There
is the point, senora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without dreaming
at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely
less wheals than my master, Don Quixote." "How is the gentleman
called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian. "Don Quixote of La Mancha,"
answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the
best and stoutest that have been seen in the world this long time
past." "What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass. "Are you so new
in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza. "Well, then, you
must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in two
words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable
and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three
crowns of kingdoms to give his squire." "Then how is it," said the
hostess, "that belonging to so good a master as this, you have not, to
judge by appearances, even so much as a county?" "It is too soon yet,"
answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month going in quest of
adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be called
one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another
thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this
wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not change
my hopes for the best title in Spain." To all this conversation Don
Quixote was listening very attentively, and sitting up in bed as well
as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said to her,
"Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in
this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do
not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said, that
self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I am. I only
tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the
service you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while
life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled
and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I
name between my teeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be
the masters of my liberty." The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy
Maritornes listened in bewilderment to the words of the knight-errant;
for they understood about as much of them as if he had been talking
Greek, though they could perceive they were all meant for expressions
of good-will and blandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind
of language, they stared at him and wondered to themselves, for he
seemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to,
and thanking him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him,
while the Asturian gave her attention to Sancho, who needed it no less
than his master. The carrier had made an arrangement with her for
recreation that night, and she had given him her word that when the
guests were quiet and the family asleep she would come in search of
him and meet his wishes unreservedly. And it is said of this good lass
that she never made promises of the kind without fulfilling them, even
though she made them in a forest and without any witness present, for
she plumed herself greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to
be in such an employment as servant in an inn, because, she said,
misfortunes and ill-luck had brought her to that position. The hard,
narrow, wretched, rickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle
of this star-lit stable, and close beside it Sancho made his, which
merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was
of threadbare canvas rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was
that of the carrier, made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles
and all the trappings of the two best mules he had, though there were
twelve of them, sleek, plump, and in prime condition, for he was one
of the rich carriers of Arevalo, according to the author of this
history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew him
very well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his;
besides which Cide Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research
and accuracy in all things, as is very evident since he would not pass
over in silence those that have been already mentioned, however
trifling and insignificant they might be, an example that might be
followed by those grave historians who relate transactions so curtly
and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them, all the substance of
the work being left in the inkstand from carelessness, perverseness,
or ignorance. A thousand blessings on the author of "Tablante de
Ricamonte" and that of the other book in which the deeds of the Conde
Tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness they describe everything!
To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them
their second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles
and lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this
time plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the
pain of his ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain of
his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's. The inn was all in silence,
and in the whole of it there was no light except that given by a
lantern that hung burning in the middle of the gateway. This strange
stillness, and the thoughts, always present to our knight's mind, of
the incidents described at every turn in the books that were the cause
of his misfortune, conjured up to his imagination as extraordinary a
delusion as can well be conceived, which was that he fancied himself
to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said, all the inns
he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughter of the
innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by
his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and had promised
to come to his bed for a while that night without the knowledge of her
parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had constructed as solid
fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which
his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to
commit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the
queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quintanona should present
themselves before him. While he was taken up with these vagaries,
then, the time and the hour--an unlucky one for him--arrived for the
Asturian to come, who in her smock, with bare feet and her hair
gathered into a fustian coif, with noiseless and cautious steps
entered the chamber where the three were quartered, in quest of the
carrier; but scarcely had she gained the door when Don Quixote
perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in spite of his plasters and
the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his arms to receive his
beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went all doubled up and in silence
with her hands before her feeling for her lover, encountered the arms
of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by the wrist, and drawing her
towards him, while she dared not utter a word, made her sit down on
the bed. He then felt her smock, and although it was of sackcloth it
appeared to him to be of the finest and softest silk: on her wrists
she wore some glass beads, but to him they had the sheen of precious
Orient pearls: her hair, which in some measure resembled a horse's
mane, he rated as threads of the brightest gold of Araby, whose
refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her breath, which no doubt smelt of
yesterday's stale salad, seemed to him to diffuse a sweet aromatic
fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, he drew her portrait in his
imagination with the same features and in the same style as that which
he had seen in his books of the other princesses who, smitten by love,
came with all the adornments that are here set down, to see the sorely
wounded knight; and so great was the poor gentleman's blindness that
neither touch, nor smell, nor anything else about the good lass that
would have made any but a carrier vomit, were enough to undeceive him;
on the contrary, he was persuaded he had the goddess of beauty in his
arms, and holding her firmly in his grasp he went on to say in low,
tender voice: "Would that found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a
position to repay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of
your great beauty, have granted me; but fortune, which is never weary
of persecuting the good, has chosen to place me upon this bed, where I
lie so bruised and broken that though my inclination would gladly
comply with yours it is impossible; besides, to this impossibility
another yet greater is to be added, which is the faith that I have
pledged to the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most
secret thoughts; and were it not that this stood in the way I should
not be so insensible a knight as to miss the happy opportunity which
your great goodness has offered me." Maritornes was fretting and
sweating at finding herself held so fast by Don Quixote, and not
understanding or heeding the words he addressed to her, she strove
without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier, whose unholy
thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment she entered
the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote said; and
jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word with him for
another, drew nearer to Don Quixote's bed and stood still to see what
would come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he
perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote striving to
hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such
a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed
all his mouth in blood, and not content with this he mounted on his
ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter
than a trot. The bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its
feet, unable to support the additional weight of the carrier, came to
the ground, and at the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at
once concluded that it must be some brawl of Maritornes', because
after calling loudly to her he got no answer. With this suspicion he
got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarter where he had heard
the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her master was coming and
knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened and panic-stricken
made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and crouching upon
it made a ball of herself. The innkeeper came in exclaiming, "Where
art thou, strumpet? Of course this is some of thy work." At this
Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass almost on top of him fancied he
had the nightmare and began to distribute fisticuffs all round, of
which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who, irritated by the pain
and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in return to Sancho that
she woke him up in spite of himself. He then, finding himself so
handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as well as he could,
grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between them began the
bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. The carrier, however,
perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared with his
ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the help she needed;
and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention, for his
was to chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she alone
was the cause of all the harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to
rat, rat to rope, rope to stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho
the lass, she him, and the innkeeper her, and all worked away so
briskly that they did not give themselves a moment's rest; and the
best of it was that the innkeeper's lamp went out, and as they were
left in the dark they all laid on one upon the other in a mass so
unmercifully that there was not a sound spot left where a hand could
light. It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a
caudrillero of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who,
also hearing the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff
and the tin case with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into
the room crying: "Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the
name of the Holy Brotherhood!" The first that he came upon was the
pummelled Don Quixote, who lay stretched senseless on his back upon
his broken-down bed, and, his hand falling on the beard as he felt
about, he continued to cry, "Help for the Jurisdiction!" but
perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did not move or stir, he
concluded that he was dead and that those in the room were his
murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice still higher,
calling out, "Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out; they have
killed a man here!" This cry startled them all, and each dropped the
contest at the point at which the voice reached him. The innkeeper
retreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the lass to
her crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable to move
from where they were. The cuadrillero on this let go Don Quixote's
beard, and went out to look for a light to search for and apprehend
the culprits; but not finding one, as the innkeeper had purposely
extinguished the lantern on retreating to his room, he was compelled
to have recourse to the hearth, where after much time and trouble he
lit another lamp. CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE
TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON QUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA
ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO HIS MISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE By
this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the same
tone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when
he lay stretched "in the vale of the stakes," he began calling to him
now, "Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend
Sancho?" "How can I sleep, curses on it!" returned Sancho
discontentedly and bitterly, "when it is plain that all the devils
have been at me this night?" "Thou mayest well believe that," answered
Don Quixote, "because, either I know little, or this castle is
enchanted, for thou must know-but this that I am now about to tell
thee thou must swear to keep secret until after my death." "I swear
it," answered Sancho. "I say so," continued Don Quixote, "because I
hate taking away anyone's good name." "I say," replied Sancho, "that I
swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship's days,
and God grant I may be able to let it out tomorrow." "Do I do thee
such injuries, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "that thou wouldst mount a
scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger." "To tell the
truth," returned Sancho, "the monstrous nose of that squire has filled
me with fear and terror, and I dare not stay near him." "It is," said
Don Quixote, "such a one that were I not what I am it would terrify me
too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou wilt." While Don Quixote
waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he of the Mirrors took
as much ground as he considered requisite, and, supposing Don Quixote
to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of trumpet or
other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse, which was not more
agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his top speed, which
was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy; seeing him,
however, engaged in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and halted in mid
career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was already
unable to go. Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was coming down upon
him flying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante's lean flanks
and made him scud along in such style that the history tells us that
on this occasion only was he known to make something like running, for
on all others it was a simple trot with him; and with this
unparalleled fury he bore down where he of the Mirrors stood digging
his spurs into his horse up to buttons, without being able to make him
stir a finger's length from the spot where he had come to a standstill
in his course. At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote came upon
his adversary, in trouble with his horse, and embarrassed with his
lance, which he either could not manage, or had no time to lay in
rest. Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these difficulties,
and in perfect safety to himself and without any risk encountered him
of the Mirrors with such force that he brought him to the ground in
spite of himself over the haunches of his horse, and with so heavy a
fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or foot.
The instant Sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, and
made all haste to where his master was, who, dismounting from
Rocinante, went and stood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his
helmet to see if he was dead, and to give him air if he should happen
to be alive, he saw--who can say what he saw, without filling all who
hear it with astonishment, wonder, and awe? He saw, the history says,
the very countenance, the very face, the very look, the very
physiognomy, the very effigy, the very image of the bachelor Samson
Carrasco! As soon as he saw it he called out in a loud voice, "Make
haste here, Sancho, and behold what thou art to see but not to
believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic can do, and wizards and
enchanters are capable of." Sancho came up, and when he saw the
countenance of the bachelor Carrasco, he fell to crossing himself a
thousand times, and blessing himself as many more. All this time the
prostrate knight showed no signs of life, and Sancho said to Don
Quixote, "It is my opinion, senor, that in any case your worship
should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of this one here that
looks like the bachelor Samson Carrasco; perhaps in him you will kill
one of your enemies, the enchanters." "Thy advice is not bad," said
Don Quixote, "for of enemies the fewer the better;" and he was drawing
his sword to carry into effect Sancho's counsel and suggestion, when
the squire of the Mirrors came up, now without the nose which had made
him so hideous, and cried out in a loud voice, "Mind what you are
about, Senor Don Quixote; that is your friend, the bachelor Samson
Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I am his squire." "And the nose?"
said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature he had before; to
which he replied, "I have it here in my pocket," and putting his hand
into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose of varnished
pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho, examining him
more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of amazement, "Holy
Mary be good to me! Isn't it Tom Cecial, my neighbour and gossip?"
"Why, to be sure I am!" returned the now unnosed squire; "Tom Cecial I
am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I'll tell you presently the
means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but
in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch,
maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his
feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised
bachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman." At this moment he of
the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote perceiving it, held the
naked point of his sword over his face, and said to him, "You are a
dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless Dulcinea del
Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty; and in addition to
this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter and fall,
to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself before her on my
behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and if
she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and
seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a
guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may have passed
between you and her-conditions which, in accordance with what we
stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of
knight-errantry." "I confess," said the fallen knight, "that the dirty
tattered shoe of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the
ill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to
return from her presence to yours, and to give you a full and
particular account of all you demand of me." "You must also confess
and believe," added Don Quixote, "that the knight you vanquished was
not and could not be Don Quixote of La Mancha, but some one else in
his likeness, just as I confess and believe that you, though you seem
to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not so, but some other
resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before me in his shape,
in order that I may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my wrath,
and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory." "I confess, hold,
and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and think it," the
crippled knight; "let me rise, I entreat you; if, indeed, the shock of
my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight enough."
Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom
Cecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put
questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was
really and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on
Sancho's mind by what his master said about the enchanters having
changed the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the
bachelor Samson Carrasco, would not permit him to believe what he saw
with his eyes. In fine, both master and man remained under the
delusion; and, down in the mouth, and out of luck, he of the Mirrors
and his squire parted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he meaning to go
look for some village where he could plaster and strap his ribs. Don
Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the
history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knight of the
Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were. CHAPTER XV. WHEREIN IT IS TOLD
AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS SQUIRE WERE Don
Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest
degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he
fancied him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he
expected to learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued;
inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of
ceasing to be one, to return and render him an account of what took
place between him and her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the
Mirrors of another, for he just then had no thought of anything but
finding some village where he could plaster himself, as has been said
already. The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor
Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his knight-errantry
which he had laid aside, it was in consequence of having been
previously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to
be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet
without worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures; at which
consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on the
special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go,
as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sally
forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for
there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that
being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and
settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor.
Then, Don Quixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command
him to return to his village and his house, and not quit it for two
years, or until he received further orders from him; all which it was
clear Don Quixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or
fail to observe the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his
seclusion he might perhaps forget his folly, or there might be an
opportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his madness. Carrasco
undertook the task, and Tom Cecial, a gossip and neighbour of Sancho
Panza's, a lively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his
squire. Carrasco armed himself in the fashion described, and Tom
Cecial, that he might not be known by his gossip when they met, fitted
on over his own natural nose the false masquerade one that has been
mentioned; and so they followed the same route Don Quixote took, and
almost came up with him in time to be present at the adventure of the
cart of Death and finally encountered them in the grove, where all
that the sagacious reader has been reading about took place; and had
it not been for the extraordinary fancies of Don Quixote, and his
conviction that the bachelor was not the bachelor, senor bachelor
would have been incapacitated for ever from taking his degree of
licentiate, all through not finding nests where he thought to find
birds. Tom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry
end their expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, "Sure enough,
Senor Samson Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan
and set about an enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to
come well out of it. Don Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off
laughing, safe, and sound, and you are left sore and sorry! I'd like
to know now which is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help
it, or he who is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever
he likes." "In that case," said Tom Cecial, "I was a madman of my own
accord when I volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own
accord, I'll leave off being one and go home." "That's your affair,"
returned Samson, "but to suppose that I am going home until I have
given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it is not any wish that
he may recover his senses that will make me hunt him out now, but a
wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won't let me entertain
more charitable thoughts." Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until
they reached a town where it was their good luck to find a
bone-setter, with whose help the unfortunate Samson was cured. Tom
Cecial left him and went home, while he stayed behind meditating
vengeance; and the history will return to him again at the proper
time, so as not to omit making merry with Don Quixote now. CHAPTER
XVI. OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH A DISCREET GENTLEMAN OF LA MANCHA
Don Quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, and
self-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorous
knight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory. All
the adventures that could befall him from that time forth he regarded
as already done and brought to a happy issue; he made light of
enchantments and enchanters; he thought no more of the countless
drubbings that had been administered to him in the course of his
knight-errantry, nor of the volley of stones that had levelled half
his teeth, nor of the ingratitude of the galley slaves, nor of the
audacity of the Yanguesans and the shower of stakes that fell upon
him; in short, he said to himself that could he discover any means,
mode, or way of disenchanting his lady Dulcinea, he would not envy the
highest fortune that the most fortunate knight-errant of yore ever
reached or could reach. He was going along entirely absorbed in these
fancies, when Sancho said to him, "Isn't it odd, senor, that I have
still before my eyes that monstrous enormous nose of my gossip, Tom
Cecial?" "And dost thou, then, believe, Sancho," said Don Quixote,
"that the Knight of the Mirrors was the bachelor Carrasco, and his
squire Tom Cecial thy gossip?" "I don't know what to say to that,"
replied Sancho; "all I know is that the tokens he gave me about my own
house, wife and children, nobody else but himself could have given me;
and the face, once the nose was off, was the very face of Tom Cecial,
as I have seen it many a time in my town and next door to my own
house; and the sound of the voice was just the same." "Let us reason
the matter, Sancho," said Don Quixote. "Come now, by what process of
thinking can it be supposed that the bachelor Samson Carrasco would
come as a knight-errant, in arms offensive and defensive, to fight
with me? Have I ever been by any chance his enemy? Have I ever given
him any occasion to owe me a grudge? Am I his rival, or does he
profess arms, that he should envy the fame I have acquired in them?"
"Well, but what are we to say, senor," returned Sancho, "about that
knight, whoever he is, being so like the bachelor Carrasco, and his
squire so like my gossip, Tom Cecial? And if that be enchantment, as
your worship says, was there no other pair in the world for them to
take the likeness of?" "It is all," said Don Quixote, "a scheme and
plot of the malignant magicians that persecute me, who, foreseeing
that I was to be victorious in the conflict, arranged that the
vanquished knight should display the countenance of my friend the
bachelor, in order that the friendship I bear him should interpose to
stay the edge of my sword and might of my arm, and temper the just
wrath of my heart; so that he who sought to take my life by fraud and
falsehood should save his own. And to prove it, thou knowest already,
Sancho, by experience which cannot lie or deceive, how easy it is for
enchanters to change one countenance into another, turning fair into
foul, and foul into fair; for it is not two days since thou sawest
with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance of the peerless Dulcinea
in all its perfection and natural harmony, while I saw her in the
repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench, with cataracts in
her eyes and a foul smell in her mouth; and when the perverse
enchanter ventured to effect so wicked a transformation, it is no
wonder if he effected that of Samson Carrasco and thy gossip in order
to snatch the glory of victory out of my grasp. For all that, however,
I console myself, because, after all, in whatever shape he may have
been, I have victorious over my enemy." "God knows what's the truth of
it all," said Sancho; and knowing as he did that the transformation of
Dulcinea had been a device and imposition of his own, his master's
illusions were not satisfactory to him; but he did not like to reply
lest he should say something that might disclose his trickery. As they
were engaged in this conversation they were overtaken by a man who was
following the same road behind them, mounted on a very handsome
flea-bitten mare, and dressed in a gaban of fine green cloth, with
tawny velvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet. The trappings
of the mare were of the field and jineta fashion, and of mulberry
colour and green. He carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broad
green and gold baldric; the buskins were of the same make as the
baldric; the spurs were not gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightly
polished that, matching as they did the rest of his apparel, they
looked better than if they had been of pure gold. When the traveller
came up with them he saluted them courteously, and spurring his mare
was passing them without stopping, but Don Quixote called out to him,
"Gallant sir, if so be your worship is going our road, and has no
occasion for speed, it would be a pleasure to me if we were to join
company." "In truth," replied he on the mare, "I would not pass you so
hastily but for fear that horse might turn restive in the company of
my mare." "You may safely hold in your mare, senor," said Sancho in
reply to this, "for our horse is the most virtuous and well-behaved
horse in the world; he never does anything wrong on such occasions,
and the only time he misbehaved, my master and I suffered for it
sevenfold; I say again your worship may pull up if you like; for if
she was offered to him between two plates the horse would not hanker
after her." The traveller drew rein, amazed at the trim and features
of Don Quixote, who rode without his helmet, which Sancho carried like
a valise in front of Dapple's pack-saddle; and if the man in green
examined Don Quixote closely, still more closely did Don Quixote
examine the man in green, who struck him as being a man of
intelligence. In appearance he was about fifty years of age, with but
few grey hairs, an aquiline cast of features, and an expression
between grave and gay; and his dress and accoutrements showed him to
be a man of good condition. What he in green thought of Don Quixote of
La Mancha was that a man of that sort and shape he had never yet seen;
he marvelled at the length of his hair, his lofty stature, the
lankness and sallowness of his countenance, his armour, his bearing
and his gravity--a figure and picture such as had not been seen in
those regions for many a long day. Don Quixote saw very plainly the
attention with which the traveller was regarding him, and read his
curiosity in his astonishment; and courteous as he was and ready to
please everybody, before the other could ask him any question he
anticipated him by saying, "The appearance I present to your worship
being so strange and so out of the common, I should not be surprised
if it filled you with wonder; but you will cease to wonder when I tell
you, as I do, that I am one of those knights who, as people say, go
seeking adventures. I have left my home, I have mortgaged my estate, I
have given up my comforts, and committed myself to the arms of
Fortune, to bear me whithersoever she may please. My desire was to
bring to life again knight-errantry, now dead, and for some time past,
stumbling here, falling there, now coming down headlong, now raising
myself up again, I have carried out a great portion of my design,
succouring widows, protecting maidens, and giving aid to wives,
orphans, and minors, the proper and natural duty of knights-errant;
and, therefore, because of my many valiant and Christian achievements,
I have been already found worthy to make my way in print to well-nigh
all, or most, of the nations of the earth. Thirty thousand volumes of
my history have been printed, and it is on the high-road to be printed
thirty thousand thousands of times, if heaven does not put a stop to
it. In short, to sum up all in a few words, or in a single one, I may
tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of
the Lions, for whom, by the disposition of heaven above, it is
reserved to give a happy issue to this adventure;" and so saying he
drew his sword and began making passes in the air at the millers, who,
hearing but not understanding all this nonsense, strove to stop the
boat, which was now getting into the rushing channel of the wheels.
Sancho fell upon his knees devoutly appealing to heaven to deliver him
from such imminent peril; which it did by the activity and quickness
of the millers, who, pushing against the boat with their poles,
stopped it, not, however, without upsetting and throwing Don Quixote
and Sancho into the water; and lucky it was for Don Quixote that he
could swim like a goose, though the weight of his armour carried him
twice to the bottom; and had it not been for the millers, who plunged
in and hoisted them both out, it would have been Troy town with the
pair of them. As soon as, more drenched than thirsty, they were
landed, Sancho went down on his knees and with clasped hands and eyes
raised to heaven, prayed a long and fervent prayer to God to deliver
him evermore from the rash projects and attempts of his master. The
fishermen, the owners of the boat, which the mill-wheels had knocked
to pieces, now came up, and seeing it smashed they proceeded to strip
Sancho and to demand payment for it from Don Quixote; but he with
great calmness, just as if nothing had happened him, told the millers
and fishermen that he would pay for the bark most cheerfully, on
condition that they delivered up to him, free and unhurt, the person
or persons that were in durance in that castle of theirs. "What
persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? Art thou for
carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?"
"That's enough," said Don Quixote to himself, "it would be preaching
in the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble to do any
virtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters must have
encountered one another, and one frustrates what the other attempts;
one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God help us,
this world is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with
the other. I can do no more." And then turning towards the mills he
said aloud, "Friends, whoe'er ye be that are immured in that prison,
forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from
your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for
some other knight." So saying he settled with the fishermen, and paid
fifty reals for the boat, which Sancho handed to them very much
against the grain, saying, "With a couple more bark businesses like
this we shall have sunk our whole capital." The fishermen and the
millers stood staring in amazement at the two figures, so very
different to all appearance from ordinary men, and were wholly unable
to make out the drift of the observations and questions Don Quixote
addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion that they were madmen,
they left them and betook themselves, the millers to their mills, and
the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixote and Sancho returned to their
beasts, and to their life of beasts, and so ended the adventure of the
enchanted bark. CHAPTER XXX. OF DON QUIXOTE'S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR
HUNTRESS They reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour
enough, knight and squire, Sancho particularly, for with him what
touched the stock of money touched his heart, and when any was taken
from him he felt as if he was robbed of the apples of his eyes. In
fine, without exchanging a word, they mounted and quitted the famous
river, Don Quixote absorbed in thoughts of his love, Sancho in
thinking of his advancement, which just then, it seemed to him, he was
very far from securing; for, fool as he was, he saw clearly enough
that his master's acts were all or most of them utterly senseless; and
he began to cast about for an opportunity of retiring from his service
and going home some day, without entering into any explanations or
taking any farewell of him. Fortune, however, ordered matters after a
fashion very much the opposite of what he contemplated. It so happened
that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of a wood, Don Quixote
cast his eyes over a green meadow, and at the far end of it observed
some people, and as he drew nearer saw that it was a hawking party.
Coming closer, he distinguished among them a lady of graceful mien, on
a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings and a
silver-mounted side-saddle. The lady was also in green, and so richly
and splendidly dressed that splendour itself seemed personified in
her. On her left hand she bore a hawk, a proof to Don Quixote's mind
that she must be some great lady and the mistress of the whole hunting
party, which was the fact; so he said to Sancho, "Run Sancho, my son,
and say to that lady on the palfrey with the hawk that I, the Knight
of the Lions, kiss the hands of her exalted beauty, and if her
excellence will grant me leave I will go and kiss them in person and
place myself at her service for aught that may be in my power and her
highness may command; and mind, Sancho, how thou speakest, and take
care not to thrust in any of thy proverbs into thy message." "You've
got a likely one here to thrust any in!" said Sancho; "leave me alone
for that! Why, this is not the first time in my life I have carried
messages to high and exalted ladies." "Except that thou didst carry to
the lady Dulcinea," said Don Quixote, "I know not that thou hast
carried any other, at least in my service." "That is true," replied
Sancho; "but pledges don't distress a good payer, and in a house where
there's plenty supper is soon cooked; I mean there's no need of
telling or warning me about anything; for I'm ready for everything and
know a little of everything." "That I believe, Sancho," said Don
Quixote; "go and good luck to thee, and God speed thee." Sancho went
off at top speed, forcing Dapple out of his regular pace, and came to
where the fair huntress was standing, and dismounting knelt before her
and said, "Fair lady, that knight that you see there, the Knight of
the Lions by name, is my master, and I am a squire of his, and at home
they call me Sancho Panza. This same Knight of the Lions, who was
called not long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, sends by
me to say may it please your highness to give him leave that, with
your permission, approbation, and consent, he may come and carry out
his wishes, which are, as he says and I believe, to serve your exalted
loftiness and beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will do a
thing which will redound to your honour, and he will receive a most
distinguished favour and happiness." "You have indeed, squire," said
the lady, "delivered your message with all the formalities such
messages require; rise up, for it is not right that the squire of a
knight so great as he of the Rueful Countenance, of whom we have heard
a great deal here, should remain on his knees; rise, my friend, and
bid your master welcome to the services of myself and the duke my
husband, in a country house we have here." Sancho got up, charmed as
much by the beauty of the good lady as by her high-bred air and her
courtesy, but, above all, by what she had said about having heard of
his master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance; for if she did not
call him Knight of the Lions it was no doubt because he had so lately
taken the name. "Tell me, brother squire," asked the duchess (whose
title, however, is not known), "this master of yours, is he not one of
whom there is a history extant in print, called 'The Ingenious
Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha,' who has for the lady of his
heart a certain Dulcinea del Toboso?" "He is the same, senora,"
replied Sancho; "and that squire of his who figures, or ought to
figure, in the said history under the name of Sancho Panza, is myself,
unless they have changed me in the cradle, I mean in the press." "I am
rejoiced at all this," said the duchess; "go, brother Panza, and tell
your master that he is welcome to my estate, and that nothing could
happen me that could give me greater pleasure." Sancho returned to his
master mightily pleased with this gratifying answer, and told him all
the great lady had said to him, lauding to the skies, in his rustic
phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, and her courtesy. Don
Quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixed himself in his
stirrups, settled his visor, gave Rocinante the spur, and with an easy
bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess, who, having sent to
summon the duke her husband, told him while Don Quixote was
approaching all about the message; and as both of them had read the
First Part of this history, and from it were aware of Don Quixote's
crazy turn, they awaited him with the greatest delight and anxiety to
make his acquaintance, meaning to fall in with his humour and agree
with everything he said, and, so long as he stayed with them, to treat
him as a knight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in the books of
chivalry they had read, for they themselves were very fond of them.
Don Quixote now came up with his visor raised, and as he seemed about
to dismount Sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but
in getting down off Dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in
one of the ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable
to free it, and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the
ground. Don Quixote, who was not used to dismount without having the
stirrup held, fancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it
for him, threw himself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante's saddle
after him, which was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both
came to the ground; not without discomfiture to him and abundant
curses muttered between his teeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had
his foot still in the shackles. The duke ordered his huntsmen to go to
the help of knight and squire, and they raised Don Quixote, sorely
shaken by his fall; and he, limping, advanced as best he could to
kneel before the noble pair. This, however, the duke would by no means
permit; on the contrary, dismounting from his horse, he went and
embraced Don Quixote, saying, "I am grieved, Sir Knight of the Rueful
Countenance, that your first experience on my ground should have been
such an unfortunate one as we have seen; but the carelessness of
squires is often the cause of worse accidents." "That which has
happened me in meeting you, mighty prince," replied Don Quixote,
"cannot be unfortunate, even if my fall had not stopped short of the
depths of the bottomless pit, for the glory of having seen you would
have lifted me up and delivered me from it. My squire, God's curse
upon him, is better at unloosing his tongue in talking impertinence
than in tightening the girths of a saddle to keep it steady; but
however I may be, allen or raised up, on foot or on horseback, I shall
always be at your service and that of my lady the duchess, your worthy
consort, worthy queen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy."
"Gently, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha," said the duke; "where my
lady Dona Dulcinea del Toboso is, it is not right that other beauties
should be praised." Sancho, by this time released from his
entanglement, was standing by, and before his master could answer he
said, "There is no denying, and it must be maintained, that my lady
Dulcinea del Toboso is very beautiful; but the hare jumps up where one
least expects it; and I have heard say that what we call nature is
like a potter that makes vessels of clay, and he who makes one fair
vessel can as well make two, or three, or a hundred; I say so because,
by my faith, my lady the duchess is in no way behind my mistress the
lady Dulcinea del Toboso." Don Quixote turned to the duchess and said,
"Your highness may conceive that never had knight-errant in this world
a more talkative or a droller squire than I have, and he will prove
the truth of what I say, look at me, printed in histories, famed in
arms, courteous in behaviour, honoured by princes, courted by maidens;
and after all, when I looked forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns,
won and earned by my valiant deeds, I have this morning seen myself
trampled on, kicked, and crushed by the feet of unclean and filthy
animals. This thought blunts my teeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my
hands, and robs me of all appetite for food; so much so that I have a
mind to let myself die of hunger, the cruelest death of all deaths."
"So then," said Sancho, munching hard all the time, "your worship does
not agree with the proverb that says, 'Let Martha die, but let her die
with a full belly.' I, at any rate, have no mind to kill myself; so
far from that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the
leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants.
I'll stretch out my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has
fixed for it; and let me tell you, senor, there's no greater folly
than to think of dying of despair as your worship does; take my
advice, and after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green
grass-mattress, and you will see that when you awake you'll feel
something better." Don Quixote did as he recommended, for it struck
him that Sancho's reasoning was more like a philosopher's than a
blockhead's, and said he, "Sancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am
going to tell thee my ease of mind would be more assured and my
heaviness of heart not so great; and it is this; to go aside a little
while I am sleeping in accordance with thy advice, and, making bare
thy carcase to the air, to give thyself three or four hundred lashes
on account of Dulcinea's disenchantment score; and this I entreat of
thee, making it a request, for I have no desire to come to grips with
thee a second time, as I know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou
hast laid them on we will pass the rest of the night, I singing my
separation, thou thy constancy, making a beginning at once with the
pastoral life we are to follow at our village." "Senor," replied
Sancho, "I'm no monk to get up out of the middle of my sleep and
scourge myself, nor does it seem to me that one can pass from one
extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music. Will your
worship let me sleep, and not worry me about whipping myself? or
you'll make me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet, not to say
my flesh." "O hard heart!" said Don Quixote, "O pitiless squire! O
bread ill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged, both those I have
done thee and those I mean to do thee! Through me hast thou seen
thyself a governor, and through me thou seest thyself in immediate
expectation of being a count, or obtaining some other equivalent
title, for I-post tenebras spero lucem." "I don't know what that is,"
said Sancho; "all I know is that so long as I am asleep I have neither
fear nor hope, trouble nor glory; and good luck betide him that
invented sleep, the cloak that covers over all a man's thoughts, the
food that removes hunger, the drink that drives away thirst, the fire
that warms the cold, the cold that tempers the heat, and, to wind up
with, the universal coin wherewith everything is bought, the weight
and balance that makes the shepherd equal with the king and the fool
with the wise man. Sleep, I have heard say, has only one fault, that
it is like death; for between a sleeping man and a dead man there is
very little difference." "Never have I heard thee speak so elegantly
as now, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "and here I begin to see the truth
of the proverb thou dost sometimes quote, 'Not with whom thou art
bred, but with whom thou art fed,' and of those, 'Who leans against a
good tree, a good shade covers him;' I have leant upon a good master,
and I have been for months going about with him, and please God I
shall be just such another; long life to him and long life to me, for
neither will he be in any want of empires to rule, or I of islands to
govern." "No, Sancho my friend, certainly not," said the duke, "for in
the name of Senor Don Quixote I confer upon you the government of one
of no small importance that I have at my disposal." "Go down on thy
knees, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and kiss the feet of his excellence
for the favour he has bestowed upon thee." Sancho obeyed, and on
seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from table completely out of
temper, exclaiming, "By the gown I wear, I am almost inclined to say
that your excellence is as great a fool as these sinners. No wonder
they are mad, when people who are in their senses sanction their
madness! I leave your excellence with them, for so long as they are in
the house, I will remain in my own, and spare myself the trouble of
reproving what I cannot remedy;" and without uttering another word, or
eating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties of the duke and
duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not that the duke said
much to him, for he could not, because of the laughter his
uncalled-for anger provoked. When he had done laughing, he said to Don
Quixote, "You have replied on your own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight
of the Lions, that there is no occasion to seek further satisfaction
for this, which, though it may look like an offence, is not so at all,
for, as women can give no offence, no more can ecclesiastics, as you
very well know." "That is true," said Don Quixote, "and what you had
best do with him is to leave him to take his chance whether he be lost
or not, for the horses we shall have when we come out victors will be
so many that even Rocinante will run a risk of being changed for
another. But attend to me and observe, for I wish to give thee some
account of the chief knights who accompany these two armies; and that
thou mayest the better see and mark, let us withdraw to that hillock
which rises yonder, whence both armies may be seen." They did so, and
placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two droves that
Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if the clouds
of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the sight;
nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and what
did not exist, he began thus in a loud voice: "That knight whom thou
seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his shield a lion
crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant Laurcalco,
lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with flowers of gold,
who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an azure field, is the
dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that other of gigantic
frame, on his right hand, is the ever dauntless Brandabarbaran de
Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour wears that serpent
skin, and has for shield a gate which, according to tradition, is one
of those of the temple that Samson brought to the ground when by his
death he revenged himself upon his enemies. But turn thine eyes to the
other side, and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other
army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel of Carcajona,
prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure,
vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat or on a field
tawny with a motto which says Miau, which is the beginning of the name
of his lady, who according to report is the peerless Miaulina,
daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens
and presses the loins of that powerful charger and bears arms white as
snow and a shield blank and without any device, is a novice knight, a
Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of the baronies of
Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes the flanks of
that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears azure vair, is
the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for
device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that
says, Rastrea mi suerte." And so he went on naming a number of knights
of one squadron or the other out of his imagination, and to all he
assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and mottoes, carried
away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; and without a pause, he
continued, "People of divers nations compose this squadron in front;
here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the famous Xanthus,
those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that sift the pure
fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famed cool banks of
the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various ways divert the
streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians, faithless in their
promises, the Persians renowned in archery, the Parthians and the
Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever shift their
dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the Ethiopians
with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose features I
recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. In this
other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams of
the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenances
with the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice
in the fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the
Tartesian plains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure
in the Elysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with
ruddy ears of corn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic
race, those that bathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle
current, those that feed their herds along the spreading pastures of
the winding Guadiana famed for its hidden course, those that tremble
with the cold of the pineclad Pyrenees or the dazzling snows of the
lofty Apennine; in a word, as many as all Europe includes and
contains." Good God! what a number of countries and nations he named!
giving to each its proper attributes with marvellous readiness;
brimful and saturated with what he had read in his lying books! Sancho
Panza hung upon his words without speaking, and from time to time
turned to try if he could see the knights and giants his master was
describing, and as he could not make out one of them he said to him:
"Senor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, knight
or giant, in the whole thing; maybe it's all enchantment, like the
phantoms last night." "How canst thou say that!" answered Don Quixote;
"dost thou not hear the neighing of the steeds, the braying of the
trumpets, the roll of the drums?" "I hear nothing but a great bleating
of ewes and sheep," said Sancho; which was true, for by this time the
two flocks had come close. "The fear thou art in, Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "prevents thee from seeing or hearing correctly, for one of
the effects of fear is to derange the senses and make things appear
different from what they are; if thou art in such fear, withdraw to
one side and leave me to myself, for alone I suffice to bring victory
to that side to which I shall give my aid;" and so saying he gave
Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on foot and loaded, and
after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they found lying
in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by jackdaws, a
mule saddled and bridled, all which still further strengthened their
suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the mule and the
saddle-pad. As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that
of a shepherd watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there
appeared a great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the
mountain the goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don
Quixote called aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they
stood. He shouted in return, asking what had brought them to that
spot, seldom or never trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the
wolves and other wild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade
him come down, and they would explain all to him. The goatherd
descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood, he said, "I
will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead in the
hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six
months; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?" "We have
come upon nobody," answered Don Quixote, "nor on anything except a
saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this." "I
found it too," said the goatherd, "but I would not lift it nor go near
it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the
devil is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fall
without knowing why or wherefore." "That's exactly what I say," said
Sancho; "I found it too, and I would not go within a stone's throw of
it; there I left it, and there it lies just as it was, for I don't
want a dog with a bell." "Tell me, good man," said Don Quixote, "do
you know who is the owner of this property?" "All I can tell you,"
said the goatherd, "is that about six months ago, more or less, there
arrived at a shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps, away from this, a
youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on that same mule
which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and valise which
you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part of this
sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was where
we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a league
farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and I am
wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road or
path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our answer
the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him,
leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his
question and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction
of the sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some days
afterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without
saying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and
kicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the
bread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again
into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us
goatherds learned this we went in search of him for about two days
through the most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we
found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out
to meet us with great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face
so disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but
that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we
had of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted us
courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder
at seeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in
order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had
been imposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were
never able to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in
want of food, which he could not do without, to tell us where we
should find him, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and
readiness; or if this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask
it of us and not take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us
for the offer, begged pardon for the late assault, and promised for
the future to ask it in God's name without offering violence to
anybody. As for fixed abode, he said he had no other than that which
chance offered wherever night might overtake him; and his words ended
in an outburst of weeping so bitter that we who listened to him must
have been very stones had we not joined him in it, comparing what we
saw of him the first time with what we saw now; for, as I said, he was
a graceful and gracious youth, and in his courteous and polished
language showed himself to be of good birth and courtly breeding, and
rustics as we were that listened to him, even to our rusticity his
gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain. "But in the midst of his
conversation he stopped and became silent, keeping his eyes fixed upon
the ground for some time, during which we stood still waiting
anxiously to see what would come of this talk which he could not
understand; but when he perceived the wench struggling to get free and
Don Quixote striving to hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his
arm and delivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous
knight that he bathed all his mouth in blood, and not content with
this he mounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at
a pace rather smarter than a trot. The bed which was somewhat crazy
and not very firm on its feet, unable to support the additional weight
of the carrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of this
the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl
of Maritornes', because after calling loudly to her he got no answer.
With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the
quarter where he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her
master was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened
and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept,
and crouching upon it made a ball of herself. The innkeeper came in
exclaiming, "Where art thou, strumpet? Of course this is some of thy
work." At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass almost on top of
him fancied he had the nightmare and began to distribute fisticuffs
all round, of which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who,
irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in
return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. He then,
finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as
well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between
them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. The
carrier, however, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how
it fared with his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the
help she needed; and the innkeeper did the same but with a different
intention, for his was to chastise the lass, as he believed that
beyond a doubt she alone was the cause of all the harmony. And so, as
the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope to stick, the carrier
pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him, and the innkeeper her, and
all worked away so briskly that they did not give themselves a
moment's rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper's lamp went
out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid on one upon the
other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a sound spot left
where a hand could light. It so happened that there was lodging that
night in the inn a caudrillero of what they call the Old Holy
Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also hearing the extraordinary noise of
the conflict, seized his staff and the tin case with his warrants, and
made his way in the dark into the room crying: "Hold! in the name of
the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the name of the Holy Brotherhood!" The
first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who lay
stretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his
hand falling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, "Help
for the Jurisdiction!" but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of
did not move or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in
the room were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his
voice still higher, calling out, "Shut the inn gate; see that no one
goes out; they have killed a man here!" This cry startled them all,
and each dropped the contest at the point at which the voice reached
him. The innkeeper retreated to his room, the carrier to his
pack-saddles, the lass to her crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho
alone were unable to move from where they were. The cuadrillero on
this let go Don Quixote's beard, and went out to look for a light to
search for and apprehend the culprits; but not finding one, as the
innkeeper had purposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his
room, he was compelled to have recourse to the hearth, where after
much time and trouble he lit another lamp. CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH ARE
CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON QUIXOTE AND HIS
GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO HIS MISFORTUNE
HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE By this time Don Quixote had recovered from his
swoon; and in the same tone of voice in which he had called to his
squire the day before when he lay stretched "in the vale of the
stakes," he began calling to him now, "Sancho, my friend, art thou
asleep? sleepest thou, friend Sancho?" "How can I sleep, curses on
it!" returned Sancho discontentedly and bitterly, "when it is plain
that all the devils have been at me this night?" "Thou mayest well
believe that," answered Don Quixote, "because, either I know little,
or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know-but this that I am now
about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until after my
death." "I swear it," answered Sancho. "I say so," continued Don
Quixote, "because I hate taking away anyone's good name." "I say,"
replied Sancho, "that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the end
of your worship's days, and God grant I may be able to let it out
tomorrow." "Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho," said Don Quixote,
"that thou wouldst see me dead so soon?" "It is not for that," replied
Sancho, "but because I hate keeping things long, and I don't want them
to grow rotten with me from over-keeping." "At any rate," said Don
Quixote, "I have more confidence in thy affection and good nature; and
so I would have thee know that this night there befell me one of the
strangest adventures that I could describe, and to relate it to thee
briefly thou must know that a little while ago the daughter of the
lord of this castle came to me, and that she is the most elegant and
beautiful damsel that could be found in the wide world. What I could
tell thee of the charms of her person! of her lively wit! of other
secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe to my lady Dulcinea
del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in silence! I will only
tell thee that, either fate being envious of so great a boon placed in
my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and this is more probable) this
castle being, as I have already said, enchanted, at the time when I
was engaged in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there
came, without my seeing or knowing whence it came, a hand attached to
some arm of some huge giant, that planted such a cuff on my jaws that
I have them all bathed in blood, and then pummelled me in such a way
that I am in a worse plight than yesterday when the carriers, on
account of Rocinante's misbehaviour, inflicted on us the injury thou
knowest of; whence conjecture that there must be some enchanted Moor
guarding the treasure of this damsel's beauty, and that it is not for
me." "Not for me either," said Sancho, "for more than four hundred
Moors have so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes
and fancy-bread to it. But tell me, senor, what do you call this
excellent and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now?
Though your worship was not so badly off, having in your arms that
incomparable beauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the
heaviest whacks I think I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the
mother that bore me! for I am not a knight-errant and never expect to
be one, and of all the mishaps, the greater part falls to my share."
"Then thou hast been thrashed too?" said Don Quixote. "Didn't I say
so? worse luck to my line!" said Sancho. "Be not distressed, friend,"
said Don Quixote, "for I will deliver thee out of the hands of the
Chaldeans, much more out of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as
thou livest, hast thou seen a more valiant knight than I in all the
known world; hast thou read in history of any who has or had higher
mettle in attack, more spirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in
wounding or skill in overthrowing?" "The truth is," answered Sancho,
"that I have never read any history, for I can neither read nor write,
but what I will venture to bet is that a more daring master than your
worship I have never served in all the days of my life, and God grant
that this daring be not paid for where I have said; what I beg of your
worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal of blood flows from
that ear, and I have here some lint and a little white ointment in the
alforjas." "All that might be well dispensed with," said Don Quixote,
"if I had remembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for
time and medicine are saved by one single drop." "What vial and what
balsam is that?" said Sancho Panza. "It is a balsam," answered Don
Quixote, "the receipt of which I have in my memory, with which one
need have no fear of death, or dread dying of any wound; and so when I
make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to do when in some
battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle of the
body--as is wont to happen frequently,--but neatly and with great
nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of the body which
shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which remains in
the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly. Then thou
shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have mentioned,
and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple." "If that be so,"
said Panza, "I renounce henceforth the government of the promised
island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many and faithful
services than that your worship give me the receipt of this supreme
liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals an
ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease
and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it."
"With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made," said Don
Quixote. "Sinner that I am!" said Sancho, "then why does your worship
put off making it and teaching it to me?" "Peace, friend," answered
Don Quixote; "greater secrets I mean to teach thee and greater favours
to bestow upon thee; and for the present let us see to the dressing,
for my ear pains me more than I could wish." Sancho took out some lint
and ointment from the alforjas; but when Don Quixote came to see his
helmet shattered, he was like to lose his senses, and clapping his
hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, be said, "I swear
by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their fullest
extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore to
avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that was not to eat bread
from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which,
though I cannot now call them to mind, I here grant as expressed)
until I take complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an
offence against me." Hearing this, Sancho said to him, "Your worship
should bear in mind, Senor Don Quixote, that if the knight has done
what was commanded him in going to present himself before my lady
Dulcinea del Toboso, he will have done all that he was bound to do,
and does not deserve further punishment unless he commits some new
offence." "Thou hast said well and hit the point," answered Don
Quixote; and so I recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh
vengeance on him, but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I
have said until such time as I take by force from some knight another
helmet such as this and as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am
raising smoke with straw in doing so, for I have one to imitate in the
matter, since the very same thing to a hair happened in the case of
Mambrino's helmet, which cost Sacripante so dear." "Senor," replied
Sancho, "let your worship send all such oaths to the devil, for they
are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the conscience;
just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in with no man
armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be observed in
spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep in
your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand other
mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis of
Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your worship
observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these
roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear
helmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives." "Thou
art wrong there," said Don Quixote, "for we shall not have been above
two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in armour
than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica." "Enough," said Sancho;
"so be it then, and God grant us success, and that the time for
winning that island which is costing me so dear may soon come, and
then let me die." "I have already told thee, Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "not to give thyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an
island should fail, there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa,
which will fit thee as a ring fits the finger, and all the more that,
being on terra firma, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let
us leave that to its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat
in those alforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some
castle where we may lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of,
for I swear to thee by God, this ear is giving me great pain." "I have
here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread," said
Sancho, "but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like your
worship." "How little thou knowest about it," answered Don Quixote; "I
would have thee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of
knights-errant to go without eating for a month, and even when they do
eat, that it should be of what comes first to hand; and this would
have been clear to thee hadst thou read as many histories as I have,
for, though they are very many, among them all I have found no mention
made of knights-errant eating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous
banquets prepared for them, and the rest of the time they passed in
dalliance. And though it is plain they could not do without eating and
performing all the other natural functions, because, in fact, they
were men like ourselves, it is plain too that, wandering as they did
the most part of their lives through woods and wilds and without a
cook, their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thou
now offer me; so that, friend Sancho, let not that distress thee which
pleases me, and do not seek to make a new world or pervert
knight-errantry." "Pardon me, your worship," said Sancho, "for, as I
cannot read or write, as I said just now, I neither know nor
comprehend the rules of the profession of chivalry: henceforward I
will stock the alforjas with every kind of dry fruit for your worship,
as you are a knight; and for myself, as I am not one, I will furnish
them with poultry and other things more substantial." "I do not say,
Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "that it is imperative on knights-errant
not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of; only that
their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs they found in
the fields which they knew and I know too." "A good thing it is,"
answered Sancho, "to know those herbs, for to my thinking it will be
needful some day to put that knowledge into practice." And here taking
out what he said he had brought, the pair made their repast peaceably
and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the night, they with
all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted at once, and
made haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but daylight
and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by the
huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there,
and it was as much to Sancho's discontent not to have reached a house,
as it was to his master's satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven,
for he fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act
of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry. CHAPTER XI. WHAT
BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS He was cordially welcomed by
the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best he could put up Rocinante
and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came from some pieces of
salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and though he would have
liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferred from the pot
to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as the goatherds removed
them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the ground, quickly
spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty good-will invited
them both to share what they had. Round the skins six of the men
belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with rough
politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they
placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho
remained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him
standing, his master said to him: "That thou mayest see, Sancho, the
good that knight-errantry contains in itself, and how those who fill
any office in it are on the high road to be speedily honoured and
esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side
and in the company of these worthy people, and that thou be one with
me who am thy master and natural lord, and that thou eat from my plate
and drink from whatever I drink from; for the same may be said of
knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all." "Great thanks," said
Sancho, "but I may tell your worship that provided I have enough to
eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by myself, than
seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth is to be
told, I cannot persuade myself that the whipping of my backside has
anything to do with the disenchantment of the enchanted; it is like
saying, 'If your head aches rub ointment on your knees;' at any rate
I'll make bold to swear that in all the histories dealing with
knight-errantry that your worship has read you have never come across
anybody disenchanted by whipping; but whether or no I'll whip myself
when I have a fancy for it, and the opportunity serves for scourging
myself comfortably." "God grant it," said Don Quixote; "and heaven
give thee grace to take it to heart and own the obligation thou art
under to help my lady, who is thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine."
As they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the
very same spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls. Don
Quixote recognised it, and said he to Sancho, "This is the meadow
where we came upon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who
were trying to revive and imitate the pastoral Arcadia there, an idea
as novel as it was happy, in emulation whereof, if so be thou dost
approve of it, Sancho, I would have ourselves turn shepherds, at any
rate for the time I have to live in retirement. I will buy some ewes
and everything else requisite for the pastoral calling; and, I under
the name of the shepherd Quixotize and thou as the shepherd Panzino,
we will roam the woods and groves and meadows singing songs here,
lamenting in elegies there, drinking of the crystal waters of the
springs or limpid brooks or flowing rivers. The oaks will yield us
their sweet fruit with bountiful hand, the trunks of the hard cork
trees a seat, the willows shade, the roses perfume, the widespread
meadows carpets tinted with a thousand dyes; the clear pure air will
give us breath, the moon and stars lighten the darkness of the night
for us, song shall be our delight, lamenting our joy, Apollo will
supply us with verses, and love with conceits whereby we shall make
ourselves famed for ever, not only in this but in ages to come."
"Egad," said Sancho, "but that sort of life squares, nay corners, with
my notions; and what is more the bachelor Samson Carrasco and Master
Nicholas the barber won't have well seen it before they'll want to
follow it and turn shepherds along with us; and God grant it may not
come into the curate's head to join the sheepfold too, he's so jovial
and fond of enjoying himself." "Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,"
said Don Quixote; "and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, if he enters the
pastoral fraternity, as no doubt he will, may call himself the
shepherd Samsonino, or perhaps the shepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the
barber may call himself Niculoso, as old Boscan formerly was called
Nemoroso; as for the curate I don't know what name we can fit to him
unless it be something derived from his title, and we call him the
shepherd Curiambro. For the shepherdesses whose lovers we shall be, we
can pick names as we would pears; and as my lady's name does just as
well for a shepherdess's as for a princess's, I need not trouble
myself to look for one that will suit her better; to thine, Sancho,
thou canst give what name thou wilt." "I don't mean to give her any
but Teresona," said Sancho, "which will go well with her stoutness and
with her own right name, as she is called Teresa; and then when I sing
her praises in my verses I'll show how chaste my passion is, for I'm
not going to look 'for better bread than ever came from wheat' in
other men's houses. It won't do for the curate to have a shepherdess,
for the sake of good example; and if the bachelor chooses to have one,
that is his look-out." "God bless me, Sancho my friend!" said Don
Quixote, "what a life we shall lead! What hautboys and Zamora bagpipes
we shall hear, what tabors, timbrels, and rebecks! And then if among
all these different sorts of music that of the albogues is heard,
almost all the pastoral instruments will be there." "What are
albogues?" asked Sancho, "for I never in my life heard tell of them or
saw them." "Albogues," said Don Quixote, "are brass plates like
candlesticks that struck against one another on the hollow side make a
noise which, if not very pleasing or harmonious, is not disagreeable
and accords very well with the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor.
The word albogue is Morisco, as are all those in our Spanish tongue
that begin with al; for example, almohaza, almorzar, alhombra,
alguacil, alhucema, almacen, alcancia, and others of the same sort, of
which there are not many more; our language has only three that are
Morisco and end in i, which are borcegui, zaquizami, and maravedi.
Alheli and alfaqui are seen to be Arabic, as well by the al at the
beginning as by the they end with. I mention this incidentally, the
chance allusion to albogues having reminded me of it; and it will be
of great assistance to us in the perfect practice of this calling that
I am something of a poet, as thou knowest, and that besides the
bachelor Samson Carrasco is an accomplished one. Of the curate I say
nothing; but I will wager he has some spice of the poet in him, and no
doubt Master Nicholas too, for all barbers, or most of them, are
guitar players and stringers of verses. I will bewail my separation;
thou shalt glorify thyself as a constant lover; the shepherd Carrascon
will figure as a rejected one, and the curate Curiambro as whatever
may please him best; and so all will go as gaily as heart could wish."
To this Sancho made answer, "I am so unlucky, senor, that I'm afraid
the day will never come when I'll see myself at such a calling. O what
neat spoons I'll make when I'm a shepherd! What messes, creams,
garlands, pastoral odds and ends! And if they don't get me a name for
wisdom, they'll not fail to get me one for ingenuity. My daughter
Sanchica will bring us our dinner to the pasture. But stay-she's
good-looking, and shepherds there are with more mischief than
simplicity in them; I would not have her 'come for wool and go back
shorn;' love-making and lawless desires are just as common in the
fields as in the cities, and in shepherds' shanties as in royal
palaces; 'do away with the cause, you do away with the sin;' 'if eyes
don't see hearts don't break' and 'better a clear escape than good
men's prayers.'" "A truce to thy proverbs, Sancho," exclaimed Don
Quixote; "any one of those thou hast uttered would suffice to explain
thy meaning; many a time have I recommended thee not to be so lavish
with proverbs and to exercise some moderation in delivering them; but
it seems to me it is only 'preaching in the desert;' 'my mother beats
me and I go on with my tricks." "It seems to me," said Sancho, "that
the knights who behaved in this way had provocation and cause for
those follies and penances; but what cause has your worship for going
mad? What lady has rejected you, or what evidence have you found to
prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso has been trifling with Moor or
Christian?" "There is the point," replied Don Quixote, "and that is
the beauty of this business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for
going mad when he has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any
provocation, and let my lady know, if I do this in the dry, what I
would do in the moist; moreover I have abundant cause in the long
separation I have endured from my lady till death, Dulcinea del
Toboso; for as thou didst hear that shepherd Ambrosio say the other
day, in absence all ills are felt and feared; and so, friend Sancho,
waste no time in advising me against so rare, so happy, and so
unheard-of an imitation; mad I am, and mad I must be until thou
returnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send by thee to
my lady Dulcinea; and if it be such as my constancy deserves, my
insanity and penance will come to an end; and if it be to the opposite
effect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, being so, I shall suffer
no more; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall escape from the
struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me, enjoying in my
senses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman not feeling the evil
thou bringest me. But tell me, Sancho, hast thou got Mambrino's helmet
safe? for I saw thee take it up from the ground when that ungrateful
wretch tried to break it in pieces but could not, by which the
fineness of its temper may be seen." To which Sancho made answer, "By
the living God, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, I cannot endure
or bear with patience some of the things that your worship says; and
from them I begin to suspect that all you tell me about chivalry, and
winning kingdoms and empires, and giving islands, and bestowing other
rewards and dignities after the custom of knights-errant, must be all
made up of wind and lies, and all pigments or figments, or whatever we
may call them; for what would anyone think that heard your worship
calling a barber's basin Mambrino's helmet without ever seeing the
mistake all this time, but that one who says and maintains such things
must have his brains addled? I have the basin in my sack all dinted,
and I am taking it home to have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if,
by God's grace, I am allowed to see my wife and children some day or
other." "Look here, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "by him thou didst
swear by just now I swear thou hast the most limited understanding
that any squire in the world has or ever had. Is it possible that all
this time thou hast been going about with me thou hast never found out
that all things belonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and
nonsense and ravings, and to go always by contraries? And not because
it really is so, but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in
attendance upon us that change and alter everything with us, and turn
things as they please, and according as they are disposed to aid or
destroy us; thus what seems to thee a barber's basin seems to me
Mambrino's helmet, and to another it will seem something else; and
rare foresight it was in the sage who is on my side to make what is
really and truly Mambrine's helmet seem a basin to everybody, for,
being held in such estimation as it is, all the world would pursue me
to rob me of it; but when they see it is only a barber's basin they do
not take the trouble to obtain it; as was plainly shown by him who
tried to break it, and left it on the ground without taking it, for,
by my faith, had he known it he would never have left it behind. Keep
it safe, my friend, for just now I have no need of it; indeed, I shall
have to take off all this armour and remain as naked as I was born, if
I have a mind to follow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance." Thus
talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like an
isolated peak among the others that surrounded it. Past its base there
flowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green and
luxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and
forest trees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms
of the spot. Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance
fixed his choice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld
it exclaimed in a loud voice as though he were out of his senses:
"This is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for
bewailing the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me: this
is the spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters
of yon little brook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stir
unceasingly the leaves of these mountain trees, in testimony and token
of the pain my persecuted heart is suffering. Oh, ye rural deities,
whoever ye be that haunt this lone spot, give ear to the complaint of
a wretched lover whom long absence and brooding jealousy have driven
to bewail his fate among these wilds and complain of the hard heart of
that fair and ungrateful one, the end and limit of all human beauty!
Oh, ye wood nymphs and dryads, that dwell in the thickets of the
forest, so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed
never disturb your sweet repose, help me to lament my hard fate or at
least weary not at listening to it! Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso, day of my
night, glory of my pain, guide of my path, star of my fortune, so may
Heaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it, bethink thee of the
place and condition to which absence from thee has brought me, and
make that return in kindness that is due to my fidelity! Oh, lonely
trees, that from this day forward shall bear me company in my
solitude, give me some sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that
my presence is not distasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire, pleasant
companion in my prosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy
memory what thou shalt see me do here, so that thou mayest relate and
report it to the sole cause of all," and so saying he dismounted from
Rocinante, and in an instant relieved him of saddle and bridle, and
giving him a slap on the croup, said, "He gives thee freedom who is
bereft of it himself, oh steed as excellent in deed as thou art
unfortunate in thy lot; begone where thou wilt, for thou bearest
written on thy forehead that neither Astolfo's hippogriff, nor the
famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so dear, could equal thee in
speed." Seeing this Sancho said, "Good luck to him who has saved us
the trouble of stripping the pack-saddle off Dapple! By my faith he
would not have gone without a slap on the croup and something said in
his praise; though if he were here I would not let anyone strip him,
for there would be no occasion, as he had nothing of the lover or
victim of despair about him, inasmuch as his master, which I was while
it was God's pleasure, was nothing of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight
of the Rueful Countenance, if my departure and your worship's madness
are to come off in earnest, it will be as well to saddle Rocinante
again in order that he may supply the want of Dapple, because it will
save me time in going and returning: for if I go on foot I don't know
when I shall get there or when I shall get back, as I am, in truth, a
bad walker." "I declare, Sancho," returned Don Quixote, "it shall be
as thou wilt, for thy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and I feel
an inclination to read it all." To which the landlord replied, "Then
your reverence will do well to read it, for I can tell you that some
guests who have read it here have been much pleased with it, and have
begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it, meaning to
return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, and papers here,
for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though I know I
shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them; for though I am an
innkeeper, still I am a Christian." "You are very right, friend," said
the curate; "but for all that, if the novel pleases me you must let me
copy it." "With all my heart," replied the host. While they were
talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read it, and
forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him to read it
so that they might all hear it. "I would read it," said the curate,
"if the time would not be better spent in sleeping." "It will be rest
enough for me," said Dorothea, "to while away the time by listening to
some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep
when it would be seasonable." "Well then, in that case," said the
curate, "I will read it, if it were only out of curiosity; perhaps it
may contain something pleasant." Master Nicholas added his entreaties
to the same effect, and Sancho too; seeing which, and considering that
he would give pleasure to all, and receive it himself, the curate
said, "Well then, attend to me everyone, for the novel begins thus."
CHAPTER XXXIII. IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF "THE ILL-ADVISED
CURIOSITY" In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the
province called Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and
quality, Anselmo and Lothario, such great friends that by way of
distinction they were called by all that knew them "The Two Friends."
They were unmarried, young, of the same age and of the same tastes,
which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between
them. Anselmo, it is true, was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure
in love than Lothario, for whom the pleasures of the chase had more
attraction; but on occasion Anselmo would forego his own tastes to
yield to those of Lothario, and Lothario would surrender his to fall
in with those of Anselmo, and in this way their inclinations kept pace
one with the other with a concord so perfect that the best regulated
clock could not surpass it. Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born
and beautiful maiden of the same city, the daughter of parents so
estimable, and so estimable herself, that he resolved, with the
approval of his friend Lothario, without whom he did nothing, to ask
her of them in marriage, and did so, Lothario being the bearer of the
demand, and conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of
his friend that in a short time he was in possession of the object of
his desires, and Camilla so happy in having won Anselmo for her
husband, that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario,
by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her. The first few
days, those of a wedding being usually days of merry-making, Lothario
frequented his friend Anselmo's house as he had been wont, striving to
do honour to him and to the occasion, and to gratify him in every way
he could; but when the wedding days were over and the succession of
visits and congratulations had slackened, he began purposely to leave
off going to the house of Anselmo, for it seemed to him, as it
naturally would to all men of sense, that friends' houses ought not to
be visited after marriage with the same frequency as in their masters'
bachelor days: because, though true and genuine friendship cannot and
should not be in any way suspicious, still a married man's honour is a
thing of such delicacy that it is held liable to injury from brothers,
much more from friends. Anselmo remarked the cessation of Lothario's
visits, and complained of it to him, saying that if he had known that
marriage was to keep him from enjoying his society as he used, he
would have never married; and that, if by the thorough harmony that
subsisted between them while he was a bachelor they had earned such a
sweet name as that of "The Two Friends," he should not allow a title
so rare and so delightful to be lost through a needless anxiety to act
circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such a phrase was allowable
between them, to be once more master of his house and to come in and
go out as formerly, assuring him that his wife Camilla had no other
desire or inclination than that which he would wish her to have, and
that knowing how sincerely they loved one another she was grieved to
see such coldness in him. To all this and much more that Anselmo said
to Lothario to persuade him to come to his house as he had been in the
habit of doing, Lothario replied with so much prudence, sense, and
judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied of his friend's good intentions,
and it was agreed that on two days in the week, and on holidays,
Lothario should come to dine with him; but though this arrangement was
made between them Lothario resolved to observe it no further than he
considered to be in accordance with the honour of his friend, whose
good name was more to him than his own. He said, and justly, that a
married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should
consider as carefully what friends he brought to his house as what
female friends his wife associated with, for what cannot be done or
arranged in the market-place, in church, at public festivals or at
stations (opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives),
may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in
whom most confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every
married man should have some friend who would point out to him any
negligence he might be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes
happen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife
either he does not caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from
telling her to do or not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which
may be a matter of honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind
he could easily correct if warned by a friend. But where is such a
friend to be found as Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and
so true? Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for
with the utmost care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his
friend, and strove to diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of
days for going to his house according to their agreement, lest the
visits of a young man, wealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he
was conscious of possessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as
Camilla, should be regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and
malicious eyes of the idle public. For though his integrity and
reputation might bridle slanderous tongues, still he was unwilling to
hazard either his own good name or that of his friend; and for this
reason most of the days agreed upon he devoted to some other business
which he pretended was unavoidable; so that a great portion of the day
was taken up with complaints on one side and excuses on the other. It
happened, however, that on one occasion when the two were strolling
together outside the city, Anselmo addressed the following words to
Lothario. "Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable
to give sufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in
making me the son of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me
with no niggard hand what are called the gifts of nature as well as
those of fortune, and above all for what he has done in giving me thee
for a friend and Camilla for a wife--two treasures that I value, if
not as highly as I ought, at least as highly as I am able. And yet,
with all these good things, which are commonly all that men need to
enable them to live happily, I am the most discontented and
dissatisfied man in the whole world; for, I know not how long since, I
have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so strange and so
unusual, that I wonder at myself and blame and chide myself when I am
alone, and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own thoughts, and
with no better success than if I were endeavouring deliberately to
publish it to all the world; and as, in short, it must come out, I
would confide it to thy safe keeping, feeling sure that by this means,
and by thy readiness as a true friend to afford me relief, I shall
soon find myself freed from the distress it causes me, and that thy
care will give me happiness in the same degree as my own folly has
caused me misery." The words of Anselmo struck Lothario with
astonishment, unable as he was to conjecture the purport of such a
lengthy preamble; and though be strove to imagine what desire it could
be that so troubled his friend, his conjectures were all far from the
truth, and to relieve the anxiety which this perplexity was causing
him, he told him he was doing a flagrant injustice to their great
friendship in seeking circuitous methods of confiding to him his most
hidden thoughts, for he well knew he might reckon upon his counsel in
diverting them, or his help in carrying them into effect. "That is the
truth," replied Anselmo, "and relying upon that I will tell thee,
friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that of knowing
whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think her to
be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by
testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her
virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded, my
friend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is
not tempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the
promises, gifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what
thanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be
bad, and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to
whom no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a
husband that will take her life the first time he detects her in an
impropriety? I do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear
or want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out of
temptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, for these
reasons and many others that I could give thee to justify and support
the opinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass
this crisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself
wooed and by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she
comes out, as I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall
look upon my good fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that
the cup of my desire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the
sage says 'Who shall find her?' has fallen to my lot. And if the
result be the contrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction of
knowing that I have been right in my opinion, I shall bear without
complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally
cause me. And, as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my
wish will avail to keep me from carrying it into effect, it is my
desire, friend Lothario, that thou shouldst consent to become the
instrument for effecting this purpose that I am bent upon, for I will
afford thee opportunities to that end, and nothing shall be wanting
that I may think necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous, honourable,
modest and high-minded woman. And among other reasons, I am induced to
entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration that if Camilla
be conquered by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes, but
only far enough to account that accomplished which from a sense of
honour will be left undone; thus I shall not be wronged in anything
more than intention, and my wrong will remain buried in the integrity
of thy silence, which I know well will be as lasting as that of death
in what concerns me. If, therefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what
can be called life, thou wilt at once engage in this love struggle,
not lukewarmly nor slothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my
desire demands, and with the loyalty our friendship assures me of."
Such were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to
them with such attention that, except to say what has been already
mentioned, he did not open his lips until the other had finished. Then
perceiving that he had no more to say, after regarding him for awhile,
as one would regard something never before seen that excited wonder
and amazement, he said to him, "I cannot persuade myself, Anselmo my
friend, that what thou hast said to me is not in jest; if I thought
that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to go
so far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to
thee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do not
know thee; but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that
I am Lothario; the misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not
the Anselmo thou wert, and must have thought that I am not the
Lothario I should be; for the things that thou hast said to me are not
those of that Anselmo who was my friend, nor are those that thou
demandest of me what should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest.
True friends will prove their friends and make use of them, as a poet
has said, usque ad aras; whereby he meant that they will not make use
of their friendship in things that are contrary to God's will. If
this, then, was a heathen's feeling about friendship, how much more
should it be a Christian's, who knows that the divine must not be
forfeited for the sake of any human friendship? And if a friend should
go so far as to put aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his
friend, it should not be in matters that are trifling or of little
moment, but in such as affect the friend's life and honour. Now tell
me, Anselmo, in which of these two art thou imperilled, that I should
hazard myself to gratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that
thou seekest of me? Neither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask
of me, so far as I understand, to strive and labour to rob thee of
honour and life, and to rob myself of them at the same time; for if I
take away thy honour it is plain I take away thy life, as a man
without honour is worse than dead; and being the instrument, as thou
wilt have it so, of so much wrong to thee, shall not I, too, be left
without honour, and consequently without life? Listen to me, Anselmo
my friend, and be not impatient to answer me until I have said what
occurs to me touching the object of thy desire, for there will be time
enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear." "Be it so," said
Anselmo, "say what thou wilt." Lothario then went on to say, "It seems
to me, Anselmo, that thine is just now the temper of mind which is
always that of the Moors, who can never be brought to see the error of
their creed by quotations from the Holy Scriptures, or by reasons
which depend upon the examination of the understanding or are founded
upon the articles of faith, but must have examples that are palpable,
easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not admitting of doubt, with
mathematical demonstrations that cannot be denied, like, 'If equals be
taken from equals, the remainders are equal:' and if they do not
understand this in words, and indeed they do not, it has to be shown
to them with the hands, and put before their eyes, and even with all
this no one succeeds in convincing them of the truth of our holy
religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall have to adopt with
thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so absurd and
remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that I feel it
would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy
simplicity, for at present I will call it by no other name; and I am
even tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for thy
pernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not
allow me to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps
me from dealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest clearly see
this, say, Anselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit
upon a modest woman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one
that is pure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast
told me so. Then, if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest,
virtuous, pure-minded and prudent, what is it that thou seekest? And
if thou believest that she will come forth victorious from all my
attacks--as doubtless she would--what higher titles than those she
possesses now dost thou think thou canst upon her then, or in what
will she be better then than she is now? Either thou dost not hold her
to be what thou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost demand. If
thou dost not hold her to be what thou sayest, or thou knowest not
what thou dost demand. If thou dost not hold her to be what thou why
dost thou seek to prove her instead of treating her as guilty in the
way that may seem best to thee? but if she be as virtuous as thou
believest, it is an uncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth
itself, for, after trial, it will but be in the same estimation as
before. Thus, then, it is conclusive that to attempt things from which
harm rather than advantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning
and reckless minds, more especially when they are things which we are
not forced or compelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it
is plainly madness to attempt them. "Difficulties are attempted either
for the sake of God or for the sake of the world, or for both; those
undertaken for God's sake are those which the saints undertake when
they attempt to live the lives of angels in human bodies; those
undertaken for the sake of the world are those of the men who traverse
such a vast expanse of water, such a variety of climates, so many
strange countries, to acquire what are called the blessings of
fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of God and the world
together are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner do they see in the
enemy's wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could make, than,
casting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding the manifest
peril that threatens them, borne onward by the desire of defending
their faith, their country, and their king, they fling themselves
dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths that await
them. Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, and there is
honour, glory, gain, in attempting them, however full of difficulty
and peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thy wish to
attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory of God nor the
blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the issue he as
thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or more
honoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt
be reduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will
avail thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune
that has befallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that
thou knowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I
say, here is my sword, that will compel incredulity itself to give
credence to it." "Calm yourself, sir knight," said Don Quixote, "and
give ear to what I am about to say to you." The first to halt were
those who were carrying the image, and one of the four ecclesiastics
who were chanting the Litany, struck by the strange figure of Don
Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrous
peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, "Brother, if you have
anything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are whipping
themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should stop to
hear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two
words." "I will say it in one," replied Don Quixote, "and it is this;
that at once, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears
and sad aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her
will, and that ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her;
and I, who was born into the world to redress all such like wrongs,
will not permit you to advance another step until you have restored to
her the liberty she pines for and deserves." From these words all the
hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and began to laugh
heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on Don Quixote's
fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush at the
stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his
comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had
for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a
mighty cut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with
the portion that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the
shoulder of Don Quixote's sword arm (which the buckler could not
protect against the clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to
the ground in a sad plight. Sancho Panza, who was coming on close
behind puffing and blowing, seeing him fall, cried out to his
assailant not to strike him again, for he was poor enchanted knight,
who had never harmed anyone all the days of his life; but what checked
the clown was, not Sancho's shouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did
not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had killed him, he hastily
hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to his heels across the
country like a deer. By this time all Don Quixote's companions had
come up to where he lay; but the processionists seeing them come
running, and with them the officers of the Brotherhood with their
crossbows, apprehended mischief, and clustering round the image,
raised their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as the priests did
their tapers, and awaited the attack, resolved to defend themselves
and even to take the offensive against their assailants if they could.
Fortune, however, arranged the matter better than they expected, for
all Sancho did was to fling himself on his master's body, raising over
him the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard,
for he believed he was dead. The curate was known to another curate
who walked in the procession, and their recognition of one another set
at rest the apprehensions of both parties; the first then told the
other in two words who Don Quixote was, and he and the whole troop of
penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho
Panza saying, with tears in his eyes, "Oh flower of chivalry, that
with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy well-spent life!
Oh pride of thy race, honour and glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all
the world, that for want of thee will be full of evil-doers, no longer
in fear of punishment for their misdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all
the Alexanders, since for only eight months of service thou hast given
me the best island the sea girds or surrounds! Humble with the proud,
haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages,
enamoured without reason, imitator of the good, scourge of the wicked,
enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which is all that can be
said!" At the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself,
and the first word he said was, "He who lives separated from you,
sweetest Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me,
friend Sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a
condition to press the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all
knocked to pieces." "That I will do with all my heart," replied
Dorothea, "if it will not be wearisome to you to hear of miseries and
misfortunes." "It will not be wearisome, senora," said Don Quixote; to
which Dorothea replied, "Well, if that be so, give me your attention."
As soon as she said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her
side, eager to hear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would
invent for herself; and Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken
in by her as his master; and she having settled herself comfortably in
the saddle, and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries
taken time to think, began with great sprightliness of manner in this
fashion. "First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is-"
and here she stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate
had given her; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty
was, and said, "It is no wonder, senora, that your highness should be
confused and embarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for
such afflictions often have the effect of depriving the sufferers of
memory, so that they do not even remember their own names, as is the
case now with your ladyship, who has forgotten that she is called the
Princess Micomicona, lawful heiress of the great kingdom of Micomicon;
and with this cue your highness may now recall to your sorrowful
recollection all you may wish to tell us." "That is the truth," said
the damsel; "but I think from this on I shall have no need of any
prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe into port, and here it
is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio the Sapient, was very
learned in what they call magic arts, and became aware by his craft
that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was to die before he
did, and that soon after he too was to depart this life, and I was to
be left an orphan without father or mother. But all this, he declared,
did not so much grieve or distress him as his certain knowledge that a
prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to our kingdom,
Pandafilando of the Scowl by name--for it is averred that, though his
eyes are properly placed and straight, he always looks askew as if he
squinted, and this he does out of malignity, to strike fear and terror
into those he looks at--that he knew, I say, that this giant on
becoming aware of my orphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a
mighty force and strip me of all, not leaving me even a small village
to shelter me; but that I could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if
I were willing to marry him; however, as far as he could see, he never
expected that I would consent to a marriage so unequal; and he said no
more than the truth in this, for it has never entered my mind to marry
that giant, or any other, let him be ever so great or enormous. My
father said, too, that when he was dead, and I saw Pandafilando about
to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait and attempt to defend myself,
for that would be destructive to me, but that I should leave the
kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to avoid the death and total
destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for there would be no
possibility of defending myself against the giant's devilish power;
and that I should at once with some of my followers set out for Spain,
where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a certain
knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the whole
kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don Azote or
Don Gigote." "'Don Quixote,' he must have said, senora," observed
Sancho at this, "otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful
Countenance." "That is it," said Dorothea; "he said, moreover, that he
would be tall of stature and lank featured; and that on his right side
under the left shoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole
with hairs like bristles." On hearing this, Don Quixote said to his
squire, "Here, Sancho my son, bear a hand and help me to strip, for I
want to see if I am the knight that sage king foretold." "What does
your worship want to strip for?" said Dorothea. "To see if I have that
mole your father spoke of," answered Don Quixote. "There is no
occasion to strip," said Sancho; "for I know your worship has just
such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark of a
strong man." "That is enough," said Dorothea, "for with friends we
must not look too closely into trifles; and whether it be on the
shoulder or on the backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a
mole, be it where it may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my
good father hit the truth in every particular, and I have made a lucky
hit in commending myself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father
spoke of, as the features of his countenance correspond with those
assigned to this knight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in
Spain but in all La Mancha; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I
heard such accounts of his achievements, that at once my heart told me
he was the very one I had come in search of." "But how did you land at
Osuna, senora," asked Don Quixote, "when it is not a seaport?" But
before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying, "The
princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the first
place where she heard of your worship was Osuna." "That is what I
meant to say," said Dorothea. "And that would be only natural," said
the curate. "Will your majesty please proceed?" "There is no more to
add," said Dorothea, "save that in finding Don Quixote I have had such
good fortune, that I already reckon and regard myself queen and
mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesy and magnanimity
he has granted me the boon of accompanying me whithersoever I may
conduct him, which will be only to bring him face to face with
Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and restore to me what
has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must come to pass
satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient foretold it,
who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or Greek
characters (for I cannot read them), that if this predicted knight,
after having cut the giant's throat, should be disposed to marry me I
was to offer myself at once without demur as his lawful wife, and
yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person." "What
thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?" said Don Quixote at this. "Hearest
thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already got a
kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!" "On my oath it is so," said
Sancho; "and foul fortune to him who won't marry after slitting Senor
Pandahilado's windpipe! And then, how ill-favoured the queen is! I
wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!" And so saying he cut a
couple of capers in the air with every sign of extreme satisfaction,
and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea's mule, and checking it
fell on his knees before her, begging her to give him her hand to kiss
in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen and mistress. Which
of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see the madness of the
master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorothea therefore gave her
hand, and promised to make him a great lord in her kingdom, when
Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and enjoy it, for
which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them all laughing
again. "This, sirs," continued Dorothea, "is my story; it only remains
to tell you that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom
I have none left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned
in a great tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I
came to land on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the
whole course of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have
observed; and if I have been over minute in any respect or not as
precise as I ought, let it be accounted for by what the licentiate
said at the beginning of my tale, that constant and excessive troubles
deprive the sufferers of their memory." "They shall not deprive me of
mine, exalted and worthy princess," said Don Quixote, "however great
and unexampled those which I shall endure in your service may be; and
here I confirm anew the boon I have promised you, and I swear to go
with you to the end of the world until I find myself in the presence
of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head I trust by the aid of my arm
to cut off with the edge of this--I will not say good sword, thanks to
Gines de Pasamonte who carried away mine"--(this he said between his
teeth, and then continued), "and when it has been cut off and you have
been put in peaceful possession of your realm it shall be left to your
own decision to dispose of your person as may be most in accordance
with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers lies prostrate on
the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest you should be
pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I am called Don
Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and captive to the
peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for the
service you have received of me I ask no more than that you should
return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present himself before the
peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal with him as shall be most
pleasing to her." The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without
discussing Don Quixote's demand or asking who Dulcinea might be,
promised that their squire should do all that had been commanded.
"Then, on the faith of that promise," said Don Quixote, "I shall do
him no further harm, though he well deserves it of me." CHAPTER X. OF
THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE
SANCHO PANZA Now by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for
the handling of the friars' muleteers, and stood watching the battle
of his master, Don Quixote, and praying to God in his heart that it
might be his will to grant him the victory, and that he might thereby
win some island to make him governor of, as he had promised. Seeing,
therefore, that the struggle was now over, and that his master was
returning to mount Rocinante, he approached to hold the stirrup for
him, and, before he could mount, he went on his knees before him, and
taking his hand, kissed it saying, "May it please your worship, Senor
Don Quixote, to give me the government of that island which has been
won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big I feel myself in
sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as well as anyone
in the world who has ever governed islands." To which Don Quixote
replied, "Thou must take notice, brother Sancho, that this adventure
and those like it are not adventures of islands, but of cross-roads,
in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear the less: have
patience, for adventures will present themselves from which I may make
you, not only a governor, but something more." Sancho gave him many
thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt of his hauberk,
helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his ass himself, proceeded
to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without taking leave, or
saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach, turned
into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at his ass's best
trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind,
he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did
so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on
reaching him said, "It seems to me, senor, it would be prudent in us
to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with
whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give
information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and,
faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat
for it." "Peace," said Don Quixote; "where hast thou ever seen or
heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of
justice, however many homicides he may have committed?" "I know
nothing about omecils," answered Sancho, "nor in my life have had
anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks
after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not
meddle." "Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend," said Don
Quixote, "for I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so
confused and upset." With this permission Sancho said to the peasants
who stood clustered round him, waiting with open mouths for the
decision to come from his, "Brothers, what the fat man requires is not
in reason, nor has it a shadow of justice in it; because, if it be
true, as they say, that the challenged may choose the weapons, the
other has no right to choose such as will prevent and keep him from
winning. My decision, therefore, is that the fat challenger prune,
peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and take eleven stone of his
flesh off his body, here or there, as he pleases, and as suits him
best; and being in this way reduced to nine stone weight, he will make
himself equal and even with nine stone of his opponent, and they will
be able to run on equal terms." "By all that's good," said one of the
peasants as he heard Sancho's decision, "but the gentleman has spoken
like a saint, and given judgment like a canon! But I'll be bound the
fat man won't part with an ounce of his flesh, not to say eleven
stone." "The best plan will be for them not to run," said another, "so
that neither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the fat one
strip himself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine, and
let's take these gentlemen to the tavern where there's the best, and
'over me be the cloak when it rains." "I thank you, sirs," said Don
Quixote; "but I cannot stop for an instant, for sad thoughts and
unhappy circumstances force me to seem discourteous and to travel
apace;" and spurring Rocinante he pushed on, leaving them wondering at
what they had seen and heard, at his own strange figure and at the
shrewdness of his servant, for such they took Sancho to be; and
another of them observed, "If the servant is so clever, what must the
master be? I'll bet, if they are going to Salamanca to study, they'll
come to be alcaldes of the Court in a trice; for it's a mere
joke--only to read and read, and have interest and good luck; and
before a man knows where he is he finds himself with a staff in his
hand or a mitre on his head." That night master and man passed out in
the fields in the open air, and the next day as they were pursuing
their journey they saw coming towards them a man on foot with alforjas
at the neck and a javelin or spiked staff in his hand, the very cut of
a foot courier; who, as soon as he came close to Don Quixote,
increased his pace and half running came up to him, and embracing his
right thigh, for he could reach no higher, exclaimed with evident
pleasure, "O Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what happiness it will be
to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows your worship is coming
back to his castle, for he is still there with my lady the duchess!"
"I do not recognise you, friend," said Don Quixote, "nor do I know who
you are, unless you tell me." "I am Tosilos, my lord the duke's
lacquey, Senor Don Quixote," replied the courier; "he who refused to
fight your worship about marrying the daughter of Dona Rodriguez."
"God bless me!" exclaimed Don Quixote; "is it possible that you are
the one whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into the lacquey you
speak of in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?" "Nonsense,
good sir!" said the messenger; "there was no enchantment or
transformation at all; I entered the lists just as much lacquey
Tosilos as I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought to marry
without fighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a
very different result, for as soon as your worship had left the castle
my lord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick given me for
having acted contrary to the orders he gave me before engaging in the
combat; and the end of the whole affair is that the girl has become a
nun, and Dona Rodriguez has gone back to Castile, and I am now on my
way to Barcelona with a packet of letters for the viceroy which my
master is sending him. If your worship would like a drop, sound though
warm, I have a gourd here full of the best, and some scraps of
Tronchon cheese that will serve as a provocative and wakener of your
thirst if so be it is asleep." "I take the offer," said Sancho; "no
more compliments about it; pour out, good Tosilos, in spite of all the
enchanters in the Indies." "Thou art indeed the greatest glutton in
the world, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and the greatest booby on
earth, not to be able to see that this courier is enchanted and this
Tosilos a sham one; stop with him and take thy fill; I will go on
slowly and wait for thee to come up with me." The lacquey laughed,
unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and taking out a small
loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on the green grass, and
in peace and good fellowship finished off the contents of the alforjas
down to the bottom, so resolutely that they licked the wrapper of the
letters, merely because it smelt of cheese. Said Tosilos to Sancho,
"Beyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this master of thine ought to be a
madman." "Ought!" said Sancho; "he owes no man anything; he pays for
everything, particularly when the coin is madness. I see it plain
enough, and I tell him so plain enough; but what's the use? especially
now that it is all over with him, for here he is beaten by the Knight
of the White Moon." Tosilos begged him to explain what had happened
him, but Sancho replied that it would not be good manners to leave his
master waiting for him; and that some other day if they met there
would be time enough for that; and then getting up, after shaking his
doublet and brushing the crumbs out of his beard, he drove Dapple on
before him, and bidding adieu to Tosilos left him and rejoined his
master, who was waiting for him under the shade of a tree. CHAPTER
LXVII. OF THE RESOLUTION DON QUIXOTE FORMED TO TURN SHEPHERD AND TAKE
TO A LIFE IN THE FIELDS WHILE THE YEAR FOR WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIS WORD
WAS RUNNING ITS COURSE; WITH OTHER EVENTS TRULY DELECTABLE AND HAPPY
If a multitude of reflections used to harass Don Quixote before he had
been overthrown, a great many more harassed him since his fall. He was
under the shade of a tree, as has been said, and there, like flies on
honey, thoughts came crowding upon him and stinging him. Some of them
turned upon the disenchantment of Dulcinea, others upon the life he
was about to lead in his enforced retirement. Sancho came up and spoke
in high praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey Tosilos. "Is
it possible, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "that thou dost still think
that he yonder is a real lacquey? Apparently it has escaped thy memory
that thou hast seen Dulcinea turned and transformed into a peasant
wench, and the Knight of the Mirrors into the bachelor Carrasco; all
the work of the enchanters that persecute me. But tell me now, didst
thou ask this Tosilos, as thou callest him, what has become of
Altisidora, did she weep over my absence, or has she already consigned
to oblivion the love thoughts that used to afflict her when I was
present?" "The thoughts that I had," said Sancho, "were not such as to
leave time for asking fool's questions. Body o' me, senor! is your
worship in a condition now to inquire into other people's thoughts,
above all love thoughts?" "Look ye, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "there
is a great difference between what is done out of love and what is
done out of gratitude. A knight may very possibly be proof against
love; but it is impossible, strictly speaking, for him to be
ungrateful. Altisidora, to all appearance, loved me truly; she gave me
the three kerchiefs thou knowest of; she wept at my departure, she
cursed me, she abused me, casting shame to the winds she bewailed
herself in public; all signs that she adored me; for the wrath of
lovers always ends in curses. I had no hopes to give her, nor
treasures to offer her, for mine are given to Dulcinea, and the
treasures of knights-errant are like those of the fairies,' illusory
and deceptive; all I can give her is the place in my memory I keep for
her, without prejudice, however, to that which I hold devoted to
Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thy remissness in whipping thyself
and scourging that flesh--would that I saw it eaten by wolves--which
would rather keep itself for the worms than for the relief of that
poor lady." "Senor," replied Sancho, "if the truth is to be told, I
like them both; though I have never seen the lady Dulcinea." "How!
never seen her, blasphemous traitor!" exclaimed Don Quixote; "hast
thou not just now brought me a message from her?" "I mean," said
Sancho, "that I did not see her so much at my leisure that I could
take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms piecemeal; but
taken in the lump I like her." "Now I forgive thee," said Don Quixote;
"and do thou forgive me the injury I have done thee; for our first
impulses are not in our control." "That I see," replied Sancho, "and
with me the wish to speak is always the first impulse, and I cannot
help saying, once at any rate, what I have on the tip of my tongue."
"For all that, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "take heed of what thou
sayest, for the pitcher goes so often to the well--I need say no more
to thee." "Well, well," said Sancho, "God is in heaven, and sees all
tricks, and will judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or
your worship in not doing it." "That is enough," said Dorothea; "run,
Sancho, and kiss your lord's hand and beg his pardon, and henceforward
be more circumspect with your praise and abuse; and say nothing in
disparagement of that lady Toboso, of whom I know nothing save that I
am her servant; and put your trust in God, for you will not fail to
obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince." Sancho advanced
hanging his head and begged his master's hand, which Don Quixote with
dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as soon as he had
kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he had questions
to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him. At the
same time he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until he came
back. In short he contrived to put so good a face on the reason, or
the folly, of his absence that no one could have suspected it was a
pretence. Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were
left alone at the table, for the rest of the household had gone to
dinner. Lothario saw himself in the lists according to his friend's
wish, and facing an enemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a
squadron of armed knights; judge whether he had good reason to fear;
but what he did was to lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his
cheek upon his hand, and, asking Camilla's pardon for his ill manners,
he said he wished to take a little sleep until Anselmo returned.
Camilla in reply said he could repose more at his ease in the
reception-room than in his chair, and begged of him to go in and sleep
there; but Lothario declined, and there he remained asleep until the
return of Anselmo, who finding Camilla in her own room, and Lothario
asleep, imagined that he had stayed away so long as to have afforded
them time enough for conversation and even for sleep, and was all
impatience until Lothario should wake up, that he might go out with
him and question him as to his success. Everything fell out as he
wished; Lothario awoke, and the two at once left the house, and
Anselmo asked what he was anxious to know, and Lothario in answer told
him that he had not thought it advisable to declare himself entirely
the first time, and therefore had only extolled the charms of Camilla,
telling her that all the city spoke of nothing else but her beauty and
wit, for this seemed to him an excellent way of beginning to gain her
good-will and render her disposed to listen to him with pleasure the
next time, thus availing himself of the device the devil has recourse
to when he would deceive one who is on the watch; for he being the
angel of darkness transforms himself into an angel of light, and,
under cover of a fair seeming, discloses himself at length, and
effects his purpose if at the beginning his wiles are not discovered.
All this gave great satisfaction to Anselmo, and he said he would
afford the same opportunity every day, but without leaving the house,
for he would find things to do at home so that Camilla should not
detect the plot. Thus, then, several days went by, and Lothario,
without uttering a word to Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he had
talked with her and that he had never been able to draw from her the
slightest indication of consent to anything dishonourable, nor even a
sign or shadow of hope; on the contrary, he said she would inform her
husband of it. "So far well," said Anselmo; "Camilla has thus far
resisted words; we must now see how she will resist deeds. I will give
you to-morrow two thousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even
present, and as many more to buy jewels to lure her, for women are
fond of being becomingly attired and going gaily dressed, and all the
more so if they are beautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she
resists this temptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no
more trouble." Lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry
on the undertaking to the end, though he perceived he was to come out
of it wearied and vanquished. The next day he received the four
thousand crowns, and with them four thousand perplexities, for he knew
not what to say by way of a new falsehood; but in the end he made up
his mind to tell him that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and
promises as against words, and that there was no use in taking any
further trouble, for the time was all spent to no purpose. But chance,
directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that Anselmo,
having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions, shut
himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen through
the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for more
than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor would
utter a word though he were to be there for an age; and he came to the
conclusion that what his friend had told him about the replies of
Camilla was all invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were
so, he came out, and calling Lothario aside asked him what news he had
and in what humour Camilla was. Lothario replied that he was not
disposed to go on with the business, for she had answered him so
angrily and harshly that he had no heart to say anything more to her.
"Ah, Lothario, Lothario," said Anselmo, "how ill dost thou meet thy
obligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I have
been just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou
has not said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former
occasions thou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no
doubt it is, why dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by
craft to deprive me of the means I might find of attaining my desire?"
Anselmo said no more, but he had said enough to cover Lothario with
shame and confusion, and he, feeling as it were his honour touched by
having been detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he would from
that moment devote himself to satisfying him without any deception, as
he would see if he had the curiosity to watch; though he need not take
the trouble, for the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove
all suspicions from his mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him
an opportunity more free and less liable to surprise, he resolved to
absent himself from his house for eight days, betaking himself to that
of a friend of his who lived in a village not far from the city; and,
the better to account for his departure to Camilla, he so arranged it
that the friend should send him a very pressing invitation. Unhappy,
shortsighted Anselmo, what art thou doing, what art thou plotting,
what art thou devising? Bethink thee thou art working against thyself,
plotting thine own dishonour, devising thine own ruin. Thy wife
Camilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her in peace and quietness, no
one assails thy happiness, her thoughts wander not beyond the walls of
thy house, thou art her heaven on earth, the object of her wishes, the
fulfilment of her desires, the measure wherewith she measures her
will, making it conform in all things to thine and Heaven's. If, then,
the mine of her honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee
without labour all the wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why
wilt thou dig the earth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown
treasure, risking the collapse of all, since it but rests on the
feeble props of her weak nature? Bethink thee that from him who seeks
impossibilities that which is possible may with justice be withheld,
as was better expressed by a poet who said: 'Tis mine to seek for life
in death, Health in disease seek I, I seek in prison freedom's breath,
In traitors loyalty. So Fate that ever scorns to grant Or grace or
boon to me, Since what can never be I want, Denies me what might be.
The next day Anselmo took his departure for the village, leaving
instructions with Camilla that during his absence Lothario would come
to look after his house and to dine with her, and that she was to
treat him as she would himself. Camilla was distressed, as a discreet
and right-minded woman would be, at the orders her husband left her,
and bade him remember that it was not becoming that anyone should
occupy his seat at the table during his absence, and if he acted thus
from not feeling confidence that she would be able to manage his
house, let him try her this time, and he would find by experience that
she was equal to greater responsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was
his pleasure to have it so, and that she had only to submit and obey.
Camilla said she would do so, though against her will. Anselmo went,
and the next day Lothario came to his house, where he was received by
Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she never suffered
Lothario to see her alone, for she was always attended by her men and
women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers, Leonela by name, to
whom she was much attached (for they had been brought up together from
childhood in her father's house), and whom she had kept with her after
her marriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothario did not speak
to her, though he might have done so when they removed the cloth and
the servants retired to dine hastily; for such were Camilla's orders;
nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier than Camilla and
never to leave her side. She, however, having her thoughts fixed upon
other things more to her taste, and wanting that time and opportunity
for her own pleasures, did not always obey her mistress's commands,
but on the contrary left them alone, as if they had ordered her to do
so; but the modest bearing of Camilla, the calmness of her
countenance, the composure of her aspect were enough to bridle the
tongue of Lothario. But the influence which the many virtues of
Camilla exerted in imposing silence on Lothario's tongue proved
mischievous for both of them, for if his tongue was silent his
thoughts were busy, and could dwell at leisure upon the perfections of
Camilla's goodness and beauty one by one, charms enough to warm with
love a marble statue, not to say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon
her when he might have been speaking to her, and thought how worthy of
being loved she was; and thus reflection began little by little to
assail his allegiance to Anselmo, and a thousand times he thought of
withdrawing from the city and going where Anselmo should never see him
nor he see Camilla. But already the delight he found in gazing on her
interposed and held him fast. He put a constraint upon himself, and
struggled to repel and repress the pleasure he found in contemplating
Camilla; when alone he blamed himself for his weakness, called himself
a bad friend, nay a bad Christian; then he argued the matter and
compared himself with Anselmo; always coming to the conclusion that
the folly and rashness of Anselmo had been worse than his
faithlessness, and that if he could excuse his intentions as easily
before God as with man, he had no reason to fear any punishment for
his offence. In short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with
the opportunity which the blind husband had placed in his hands,
overthrew the loyalty of Lothario; and giving heed to nothing save the
object towards which his inclinations led him, after Anselmo had been
three days absent, during which he had been carrying on a continual
struggle with his passion, he began to make love to Camilla with so
much vehemence and warmth of language that she was overwhelmed with
amazement, and could only rise from her place and retire to her room
without answering him a word. But the hope which always springs up
with love was not weakened in Lothario by this repelling demeanour; on
the contrary his passion for Camilla increased, and she discovering in
him what she had never expected, knew not what to do; and considering
it neither safe nor right to give him the chance or opportunity of
speaking to her again, she resolved to send, as she did that very
night, one of her servants with a letter to Anselmo, in which she
addressed the following words to him. CHAPTER XXXIV. IN WHICH IS
CONTINUED THE NOVEL OF "THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY" "It is commonly
said that an army looks ill without its general and a castle without
its castellan, and I say that a young married woman looks still worse
without her husband unless there are very good reasons for it. I find
myself so ill at ease without you, and so incapable of enduring this
separation, that unless you return quickly I shall have to go for
relief to my parents' house, even if I leave yours without a
protector; for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved that title,
has, I think, more regard to his own pleasure than to what concerns
you: as you are possessed of discernment I need say no more to you,
nor indeed is it fitting I should say more." Anselmo received this
letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario had already begun his
task and that Camilla must have replied to him as he would have
wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he sent word
to her not to leave his house on any account, as he would very shortly
return. Camilla was astonished at Anselmo's reply, which placed her in
greater perplexity than before, for she neither dared to remain in her
own house, nor yet to go to her parents'; for in remaining her virtue
was imperilled, and in going she was opposing her husband's commands.
Finally she decided upon what was the worse course for her, to remain,
resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario, that she might not
give food for gossip to her servants; and she now began to regret
having written as she had to her husband, fearing he might imagine
that Lothario had perceived in her some lightness which had impelled
him to lay aside the respect he owed her; but confident of her
rectitude she put her trust in God and in her own virtuous intentions,
with which she hoped to resist in silence all the solicitations of
Lothario, without saying anything to her husband so as not to involve
him in any quarrel or trouble; and she even began to consider how to
excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he should ask her what it was that
induced her to write that letter. With these resolutions, more
honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained the next day
listening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously that
Camilla's firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do to
come to the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a
certain tender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had
awakened in her bosom. Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him
all the more. In short he felt that while Anselmo's absence afforded
time and opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress, and so
he assailed her self-esteem with praises of her beauty, for there is
nothing that more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair
women's vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery. In fact
with the utmost assiduity he undermined the rock of her purity with
such engines that had Camilla been of brass she must have fallen. He
wept, he entreated, he promised, he flattered, he importuned, he
pretended with so much feeling and apparent sincerity, that he
overthrew the virtuous resolves of Camilla and won the triumph he
least expected and most longed for. Camilla yielded, Camilla fell; but
what wonder if the friendship of Lothario could not stand firm? A
clear proof to us that the passion of love is to be conquered only by
flying from it, and that no one should engage in a struggle with an
enemy so mighty; for divine strength is needed to overcome his human
power. Leonela alone knew of her mistress's weakness, for the two
false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal it. Lothario did
not care to tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, nor that he
had afforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result, lest she
should undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and without
intending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to her. A
few days later Anselmo returned to his house and did not perceive what
it had lost, that which he so lightly treated and so highly prized. He
went at once to see Lothario, and found him at home; they embraced
each other, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his life or his
death. "The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend," said
Lothario, "are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the
pattern and crown of all good wives. The words that I have addressed
to her were borne away on the wind, my promises have been despised, my
presents have been refused, such feigned tears as I shed have been
turned into open ridicule. In short, as Camilla is the essence of all
beauty, so is she the treasure-house where purity dwells, and
gentleness and modesty abide with all the virtues that can confer
praise, honour, and happiness upon a woman. Take back thy money, my
friend; here it is, and I have had no need to touch it, for the
chastity of Camilla yields not to things so base as gifts or promises.
Be content, Anselmo, and refrain from making further proof; and as
thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts and
suspicions that are and may be entertained of women, seek not to
plunge again into the deep ocean of new embarrassments, or with
another pilot make trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that
Heaven has granted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world;
but reckon thyself now safe in port, moor thyself with the anchor of
sound reflection, and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay
that debt which no nobility on earth can escape paying." Anselmo was
completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believed them as
fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he begged
of him not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the sake of
curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not make use of
the same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to do was to
write some verses to her, praising her under the name of Chloris, for
he himself would give her to understand that he was in love with a
lady to whom he had given that name to enable him to sing her praises
with the decorum due to her modesty; and if Lothario were unwilling to
take the trouble of writing the verses he would compose them himself.
"That will not be necessary," said Lothario, "for the muses are not
such enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course
of the year. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a
pretended amour of mine; as for the verses will make them, and if not
as good as the subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can
produce." An agreement to this effect was made between the friends,
the ill-advised one and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his
house asked Camilla the question she already wondered he had not asked
before--what it was that had caused her to write the letter she had
sent him. Camilla replied that it had seemed to her that Lothario
looked at her somewhat more freely than when he had been at home; but
that now she was undeceived and believed it to have been only her own
imagination, for Lothario now avoided seeing her, or being alone with
her. Anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of that
suspicion, for he knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rank
in the city whom he celebrated under the name of Chloris, and that
even if he were not, his fidelity and their great friendship left no
room for fear. Had not Camilla, however, been informed beforehand by
Lothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence, and that he
himself had told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give
utterance to the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she would have
fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned she
received the startling news without uneasiness. The next day as the
three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to recite something of what
he had composed for his mistress Chloris; for as Camilla did not know
her, he might safely say what he liked. "Even did she know her,"
returned Lothario, "I would hide nothing, for when a lover praises his
lady's beauty, and charges her with cruelty, he casts no imputation
upon her fair name; at any rate, all I can say is that yesterday I
made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris, which goes thus:
SONNET At midnight, in the silence, when the eyes Of happier mortals
balmy slumbers close, The weary tale of my unnumbered woes To Chloris
and to Heaven is wont to rise. And when the light of day returning
dyes The portals of the east with tints of rose, With undiminished
force my sorrow flows In broken accents and in burning sighs. And when
the sun ascends his star-girt throne, And on the earth pours down his
midday beams, Noon but renews my wailing and my tears; And with the
night again goes up my moan. Yet ever in my agony it seems To me that
neither Heaven nor Chloris hears." The sonnet pleased Camilla, and
still more Anselmo, for he praised it and said the lady was
excessively cruel who made no return for sincerity so manifest. On
which Camilla said, "Then all that love-smitten poets say is true?"
"As poets they do not tell the truth," replied Lothario; "but as
lovers they are not more defective in expression than they are
truthful." "There is no doubt of that," observed Anselmo, anxious to
support and uphold Lothario's ideas with Camilla, who was as
regardless of his design as she was deep in love with Lothario; and so
taking delight in anything that was his, and knowing that his thoughts
and writings had her for their object, and that she herself was the
real Chloris, she asked him to repeat some other sonnet or verses if
he recollected any. "I do," replied Lothario, "but I do not think it
as good as the first one, or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but
you can easily judge, for it is this. SONNET I know that I am doomed;
death is to me As certain as that thou, ungrateful fair, Dead at thy
feet shouldst see me lying, ere My heart repented of its love for
thee. If buried in oblivion I should be, Bereft of life, fame, favour,
even there It would be found that I thy image bear Deep graven in my
breast for all to see. This like some holy relic do I prize To save me
from the fate my truth entails, Truth that to thy hard heart its
vigour owes. Alas for him that under lowering skies, In peril o'er a
trackless ocean sails, Where neither friendly port nor pole-star
shows." Anselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the
first; and so he went on adding link after link to the chain with
which he was binding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when
Lothario was doing most to dishonour him he told him he was most
honoured; and thus each step that Camilla descended towards the depths
of her abasement, she mounted, in his opinion, towards the summit of
virtue and fair fame. It so happened that finding herself on one
occasion alone with her maid, Camilla said to her, "I am ashamed to
think, my dear Leonela, how lightly I have valued myself that I did
not compel Lothario to purchase by at least some expenditure of time
that full possession of me that I so quickly yielded him of my own
free will. I fear that he will think ill of my pliancy or lightness,
not considering the irresistible influence he brought to bear upon
me." "Let not that trouble you, my lady," said Leonela, "for it does
not take away the value of the thing given or make it the less
precious to give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of
being prized; nay, they are wont to say that he who gives quickly
gives twice." "They say also," said Camilla, "that what costs little
is valued less." "That saying does not hold good in your case,"
replied Leonela, "for love, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and
sometimes walks; with this one it runs, with that it moves slowly;
some it cools, others it burns; some it wounds, others it slays; it
begins the course of its desires, and at the same moment completes and
ends it; in the morning it will lay siege to a fortress and by night
will have taken it, for there is no power that can resist it; so what
are you in dread of, what do you fear, when the same must have
befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence of my lord as the
instrument for subduing you? and it was absolutely necessary to
complete then what love had resolved upon, without affording the time
to let Anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be left
unfinished; for love has no better agent for carrying out his designs
than opportunity; and of opportunity he avails himself in all his
feats, especially at the outset. All this I know well myself, more by
experience than by hearsay, and some day, senora, I will enlighten you
on the subject, for I am of your flesh and blood too. Moreover, lady
Camilla, you did not surrender yourself or yield so quickly but that
first you saw Lothario's whole soul in his eyes, in his sighs, in his
words, his promises and his gifts, and by it and his good qualities
perceived how worthy he was of your love. This, then, being the case,
let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas trouble your imagination,
but be assured that Lothario prizes you as you do him, and rest
content and satisfied that as you are caught in the noose of love it
is one of worth and merit that has taken you, and one that has not
only the four S's that they say true lovers ought to have, but a
complete alphabet; only listen to me and you will see how I can repeat
it by rote. He is to my eyes and thinking, Amiable, Brave, Courteous,
Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable, Illustrious, Loyal,
Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and the S's according
to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X does not suit him, for it
is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealous for your
honour." Camilla laughed at her maid's alphabet, and perceived her to
be more experienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted,
confessing to Camilla that she had love passages with a young man of
good birth of the same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest
it might prove the means of endangering her honour, and asked whether
her intrigue had gone beyond words, and she with little shame and much
effrontery said it had; for certain it is that ladies' imprudences
make servants shameless, who, when they see their mistresses make a
false step, think nothing of going astray themselves, or of its being
known. All that Camilla could do was to entreat Leonela to say nothing
about her doings to him whom she called her lover, and to conduct her
own affairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of Anselmo
or of Lothario. Leonela said she would, but kept her word in such a
way that she confirmed Camilla's apprehension of losing her reputation
through her means; for this abandoned and bold Leonela, as soon as she
perceived that her mistress's demeanour was not what it was wont to
be, had the audacity to introduce her lover into the house, confident
that even if her mistress saw him she would not dare to expose him;
for the sins of mistresses entail this mischief among others; they
make themselves the slaves of their own servants, and are obliged to
hide their laxities and depravities; as was the case with Camilla, who
though she perceived, not once but many times, that Leonela was with
her lover in some room of the house, not only did not dare to chide
her, but afforded her opportunities for concealing him and removed all
difficulties, lest he should be seen by her husband. She was unable,
however, to prevent him from being seen on one occasion, as he sallied
forth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he was, at first
took him for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten away,
muffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and
cautiously, he rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which
would have been the ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It did
not occur to Lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an
untimely hour from Anselmo's house could have entered it on Leonela's
account, nor did he even remember there was such a person as Leonela;
all he thought was that as Camilla had been light and yielding with
him, so she had been with another; for this further penalty the erring
woman's sin brings with it, that her honour is distrusted even by him
to whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded; and he believes
her to have surrendered more easily to others, and gives implicit
credence to every suspicion that comes into his mind. All Lothario's
good sense seems to have failed him at this juncture; all his prudent
maxims escaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally, and
without more ado, in his impatience and in the blindness of the
jealous rage that gnawed his heart, and dying to revenge himself upon
Camilla, who had done him no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he
hastened to him and said to him, "Know, Anselmo, that for several days
past I have been struggling with myself, striving to withhold from
thee what it is no longer possible or right that I should conceal from
thee. Know that Camilla's fortress has surrendered and is ready to
submit to my will; and if I have been slow to reveal this fact to
thee, it was in order to see if it were some light caprice of hers, or
if she sought to try me and ascertain if the love I began to make to
her with thy permission was made with a serious intention. I thought,
too, that she, if she were what she ought to be, and what we both
believed her, would have ere this given thee information of my
addresses; but seeing that she delays, I believe the truth of the
promise she has given me that the next time thou art absent from the
house she will grant me an interview in the closet where thy jewels
are kept (and it was true that Camilla used to meet him there); but I
do not wish thee to rush precipitately to take vengeance, for the sin
is as yet only committed in intention, and Camilla's may change
perhaps between this and the appointed time, and repentance spring up
in its place. As hitherto thou hast always followed my advice wholly
or in part, follow and observe this that I will give thee now, so
that, without mistake, and with mature deliberation, thou mayest
satisfy thyself as to what may seem the best course; pretend to absent
thyself for two or three days as thou hast been wont to do on other
occasions, and contrive to hide thyself in the closet; for the
tapestries and other things there afford great facilities for thy
concealment, and then thou wilt see with thine own eyes and I with
mine what Camilla's purpose may be. And if it be a guilty one, which
may be feared rather than expected, with silence, prudence, and
discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of punishment for
the wrong done thee." Anselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded
at the words of Lothario, which came upon him at a time when he least
expected to hear them, for he now looked upon Camilla as having
triumphed over the pretended attacks of Lothario, and was beginning to
enjoy the glory of her victory. He remained silent for a considerable
time, looking on the ground with fixed gaze, and at length said, "Thou
hast behaved, Lothario, as I expected of thy friendship: I will follow
thy advice in everything; do as thou wilt, and keep this secret as
thou seest it should be kept in circumstances so unlooked for."
Lothario gave him his word, but after leaving him he repented
altogether of what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he had
acted, as he might have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less
cruel and degrading way. He cursed his want of sense, condemned his
hasty resolution, and knew not what course to take to undo the
mischief or find some ready escape from it. At last he decided upon
revealing all to Camilla, and, as there was no want of opportunity for
doing so, he found her alone the same day; but she, as soon as she had
the chance of speaking to him, said, "Lothario my friend, I must tell
thee I have a sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready
to burst; and it will be a wonder if it does not; for the audacity of
Leonela has now reached such a pitch that every night she conceals a
gallant of hers in this house and remains with him till morning, at
the expense of my reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to
question it who may see him quitting my house at such unseasonable
hours; but what distresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her,
for her privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent
about hers, while I am dreading that some catastrophe will come of
it." As Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some
device to delude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out
was Leonela's lover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and
suffered, and begged him to help her, he became convinced of the
truth, and the conviction completed his confusion and remorse;
however, he told Camilla not to distress herself, as he would take
measures to put a stop to the insolence of Leonela. At the same time
he told her what, driven by the fierce rage of jealousy, he had said
to Anselmo, and how he had arranged to hide himself in the closet that
he might there see plainly how little she preserved her fidelity to
him; and he entreated her pardon for this madness, and her advice as
to how to repair it, and escape safely from the intricate labyrinth in
which his imprudence had involved him. Camilla was struck with alarm
at hearing what Lothario said, and with much anger, and great good
sense, she reproved him and rebuked his base design and the foolish
and mischievous resolution he had made; but as woman has by nature a
nimbler wit than man for good and for evil, though it is apt to fail
when she sets herself deliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of
the moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance
irremediable, and told Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo
should conceal himself in the place he mentioned, for she hoped from
his concealment to obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for
the future without any apprehension; and without revealing her purpose
to him entirely she charged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was
concealed, to come to her when Leonela should call him, and to all she
said to him to answer as he would have answered had he not known that
Anselmo was listening. Lothario pressed her to explain her intention
fully, so that he might with more certainty and precaution take care
to do what he saw to be needful. "I tell you," said Camilla, "there is
nothing to take care of except to answer me what I shall ask you;" for
she did not wish to explain to him beforehand what she meant to do,
fearing lest he should be unwilling to follow out an idea which seemed
to her such a good one, and should try or devise some other less
practicable plan. Lothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo,
under pretence of going to his friend's country house, took his
departure, and then returned to conceal himself, which he was able to
do easily, as Camilla and Leonela took care to give him the
opportunity; and so he placed himself in hiding in the state of
agitation that it may be imagined he would feel who expected to see
the vitals of his honour laid bare before his eyes, and found himself
on the point of losing the supreme blessing he thought he possessed in
his beloved Camilla. Having made sure of Anselmo's being in his
hiding-place, Camilla and Leonela entered the closet, and the instant
she set foot within it Camilla said, with a deep sigh, "Ah! dear
Leonela, would it not be better, before I do what I am unwilling you
should know lest you should seek to prevent it, that you should take
Anselmo's dagger that I have asked of you and with it pierce this vile
heart of mine? But no; there is no reason why I should conceal it from
you, while my servant here is taking off my armour I will tell you the
true state of the case, without leaving out anything. You must know,
senor, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. I am of the same
village as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and folly make all of
us who know him feel pity for him, and I am one of those who have felt
it most; and persuaded that his chance of recovery lay in quiet and
keeping at home and in his own house, I hit upon a device for keeping
him there. Three months ago, therefore, I went out to meet him as a
knight-errant, under the assumed name of the Knight of the Mirrors,
intending to engage him in combat and overcome him without hurting
him, making it the condition of our combat that the vanquished should
be at the disposal of the victor. What I meant to demand of him (for I
regarded him as vanquished already) was that he should return to his
own village, and not leave it for a whole year, by which time he might
be cured. But fate ordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me and
unhorsed me, and so my plan failed. He went his way, and I came back
conquered, covered with shame, and sorely bruised by my fall, which
was a particularly dangerous one. But this did not quench my desire to
meet him again and overcome him, as you have seen to-day. And as he is
so scrupulous in his observance of the laws of knight-errantry, he
will, no doubt, in order to keep his word, obey the injunction I have
laid upon him. This, senor, is how the matter stands, and I have
nothing more to tell you. I implore of you not to betray me, or tell
Don Quixote who I am; so that my honest endeavours may be successful,
and that a man of excellent wits--were he only rid of the fooleries of
chivalry--may get them back again." "O senor," said Don Antonio, "may
God forgive you the wrong you have done the whole world in trying to
bring the most amusing madman in it back to his senses. Do you not
see, senor, that the gain by Don Quixote's sanity can never equal the
enjoyment his crazes give? But my belief is that all the senor
bachelor's pains will be of no avail to bring a man so hopelessly
cracked to his senses again; and if it were not uncharitable, I would
say may Don Quixote never be cured, for by his recovery we lose not
only his own drolleries, but his squire Sancho Panza's too, any one of
which is enough to turn melancholy itself into merriment. However,
I'll hold my peace and say nothing to him, and we'll see whether I am
right in my suspicion that Senor Carrasco's efforts will be
fruitless." The bachelor replied that at all events the affair
promised well, and he hoped for a happy result from it; and putting
his services at Don Antonio's commands he took his leave of him; and
having had his armour packed at once upon a mule, he rode away from
the city the same day on the horse he rode to battle, and returned to
his own country without meeting any adventure calling for record in
this veracious history. Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what
Carrasco told him, and the viceroy was not very well pleased to hear
it, for with Don Quixote's retirement there was an end to the
amusement of all who knew anything of his mad doings. Six days did Don
Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and out of sorts,
brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho strove to
comfort him, and among other things he said to him, "Hold up your
head, senor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to
heaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come
off with a broken rib; and, as you know that 'where they give they
take,' and that 'there are not always fletches where there are pegs,'
a fig for the doctor, for there's no need of him to cure this ailment.
Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures in
strange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am the
greater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage.
With the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but I
did not give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come to
pass if your worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the
calling of chivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke."
"Peace, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "thou seest my suspension and
retirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return to my honoured
calling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a
county to bestow on thee." "May God hear it and sin be deaf," said
Sancho; "I have always heard say that 'a good hope is better than a
bad holding, and a good grievance better than a bad compensation. I
speak in this way, Sancho, to show you that I can shower down proverbs
just as well as yourself; and in short, I mean to say, and I do say,
that if you don't like to come on reward with me, and run the same
chance that I run, God be with you and make a saint of you; for I
shall find plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking, and not so
thickheaded or talkative as you are." When Sancho heard his master's
firm, resolute language, a cloud came over the sky with him and the
wings of his heart drooped, for he had made sure that his master would
not go without him for all the wealth of the world; and as he stood
there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson Carrasco came in with the
housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to hear by what arguments he
was about to dissuade their master from going to seek adventures. The
arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him as he had done before,
said with a loud voice, "O flower of knight-errantry! O shining light
of arms! O honour and mirror of the Spanish nation! may God Almighty
in his infinite power grant that any person or persons, who would
impede or hinder thy third sally, may find no way out of the labyrinth
of their schemes, nor ever accomplish what they most desire!" And
then, turning to the housekeeper, he said, "Mistress housekeeper may
just as well give over saying the prayer of Santa Apollonia, for I
know it is the positive determination of the spheres that Senor Don
Quixote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs;
and I should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did I not urge and
persuade this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the
virtue of his valiant spirit any longer curbed and checked, for by his
inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs, of the
protection of orphans, of the honour of virgins, of the aid of widows,
and of the support of wives, and other matters of this kind
appertaining, belonging, proper and peculiar to the order of
knight-errantry. On, then, my lord Don Quixote, beautiful and brave,
let your worship and highness set out to-day rather than to-morrow;
and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose, here am I
ready in person and purse to supply the want; and were it requisite to
attend your magnificence as squire, I should esteem it the happiest
good fortune." At this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, "Did I
not tell thee, Sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for
me? See now who offers to become one; no less than the illustrious
bachelor Samson Carrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts
of the Salamancan schools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat
or cold, hunger or thirst, with all the qualifications requisite to
make one, showing him sagacious in foreseeing the wiles of the enemy,
eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his soldiers, ripe in
counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold in biding his time as in pressing
the attack; now picturing some sad tragic incident, now some joyful
and unexpected event; here a beauteous lady, virtuous, wise, and
modest; there a Christian knight, brave and gentle; here a lawless,
barbarous braggart; there a courteous prince, gallant and gracious;
setting forth the devotion and loyalty of vassals, the greatness and
generosity of nobles. "Or again," said he, "the author may show
himself to be an astronomer, or a skilled cosmographer, or musician,
or one versed in affairs of state, and sometimes he will have a chance
of coming forward as a magician if he likes. He can set forth the
craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of AEneas, the valour of Achilles,
the misfortunes of Hector, the treachery of Sinon, the friendship of
Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, the boldness of Caesar, the
clemency and truth of Trajan, the fidelity of Zopyrus, the wisdom of
Cato, and in short all the faculties that serve to make an illustrious
man perfect, now uniting them in one individual, again distributing
them among many; and if this be done with charm of style and ingenious
invention, aiming at the truth as much as possible, he will assuredly
weave a web of bright and varied threads that, when finished, will
display such perfection and beauty that it will attain the worthiest
object any writing can seek, which, as I said before, is to give
instruction and pleasure combined; for the unrestricted range of these
books enables the author to show his powers, epic, lyric, tragic, or
comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of poesy and
oratory are capable of; for the epic may be written in prose just as
well as in verse." CHAPTER XLVIII. IN WHICH THE CANON PURSUES THE
SUBJECT OF THE BOOKS OF CHIVALRY, WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF HIS WIT
"It is as you say, senor canon," said the curate; "and for that reason
those who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more
censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the
rules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as
famous in prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in
verse." "I myself, at any rate," said the canon, "was once tempted to
write a book of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were
to be observed; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred
sheets written; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I
showed them to persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to
learned and intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared
for nothing but the pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I
obtained flattering approval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with
it, as well because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my
profession, as because I perceived that the fools are more numerous
than the wise; and, though it is better to be praised by the wise few
than applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind to submit myself to
the stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the reading of such
books falls for the most part. "But what most of all made me hold my
hand and even abandon all idea of finishing it was an argument I put
to myself taken from the plays that are acted now-a-days, which was in
this wise: if those that are now in vogue, as well those that are pure
invention as those founded on history, are, all or most of them,
downright nonsense and things that have neither head nor tail, and yet
the public listens to them with delight, and regards and cries them up
as perfection when they are so far from it; and if the authors who
write them, and the players who act them, say that this is what they
must be, for the public wants this and will have nothing else; and
that those that go by rule and work out a plot according to the laws
of art will only find some half-dozen intelligent people to understand
them, while all the rest remain blind to the merit of their
composition; and that for themselves it is better to get bread from
the many than praise from the few; then my book will fare the same
way, after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the
principles I have spoken of, and I shall be 'the tailor of the
corner.' And though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors
that they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted, and that they
would attract more people, and get more credit, by producing plays in
accordance with the rules of art, than by absurd ones, they are so
thoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence
can wean them from it. "I remember saying one day to one of these
obstinate fellows, 'Tell me, do you not recollect that a few years
ago, there were three tragedies acted in Spain, written by a famous
poet of these kingdoms, which were such that they filled all who heard
them with admiration, delight, and interest, the ignorant as well as
the wise, the masses as well as the higher orders, and brought in more
money to the performers, these three alone, than thirty of the best
that have been since produced?' "'No doubt,' replied the actor in
question, 'you mean the "Isabella," the "Phyllis," and the
"Alexandra."' "'Those are the ones I mean,' said I; 'and see if they
did not observe the principles of art, and if, by observing them, they
failed to show their superiority and please all the world; so that the
fault does not lie with the public that insists upon nonsense, but
with those who don't know how to produce something else. "The
Ingratitude Revenged" was not nonsense, nor was there any in "The
Numantia," nor any to be found in "The Merchant Lover," nor yet in
"The Friendly Fair Foe," nor in some others that have been written by
certain gifted poets, to their own fame and renown, and to the profit
of those that brought them out;' some further remarks I added to
these, with which, I think, I left him rather dumbfoundered, but not
so satisfied or convinced that I could disabuse him of his error."
"You have touched upon a subject, senor canon," observed the curate
here, "that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in
vogue at the present day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the
books of chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be
the mirror of human life, the model of manners, and the image of the
truth, those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense,
models of folly, and images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can
there be in connection with what we are now discussing than for an
infant to appear in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first
act, and in the second a grown-up bearded man? Or what greater
absurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as a
swashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey using fine language,
a page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, a princess who
is a kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of their attention to the
time in which the action they represent may or can take place, save
that I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe, the
second in Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it
been in four acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it
would have been laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if truth
to life is the main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it
possible for any average understanding to be satisfied when the action
is supposed to pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the
principal personage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius
who entered Jerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like
Godfrey of Bouillon, there being years innumerable between the one and
the other? or, if the play is based on fiction and historical facts
are introduced, or bits of what occurred to different people and at
different times mixed up with it, all, not only without any semblance
of probability, but with obvious errors that from every point of view
are inexcusable? And the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who
say that this is perfection, and that anything beyond this is affected
refinement. And then if we turn to sacred dramas--what miracles they
invent in them! What apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to
one saint the miracles of another! And even in secular plays they
venture to introduce miracles without any reason or object except that
they think some such miracle, or transformation as they call it, will
come in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play. All
this tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of
history, nay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for
foreigners who scrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us
as barbarous and ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of
the plays we produce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that
the chief object well-ordered governments have in view when they
permit plays to be performed in public is to entertain the people with
some harmless amusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil
humours which idleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be
attained by any sort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay
down laws, or bind those who write or act them to make them as they
ought to be made, since, as I say, the object sought for may be
secured by any sort. To this I would reply that the same end would be,
beyond all comparison, better attained by means of good plays than by
those that are not so; for after listening to an artistic and properly
constructed play, the hearer will come away enlivened by the jests,
instructed by the serious parts, full of admiration at the incidents,
his wits sharpened by the arguments, warned by the tricks, all the
wiser for the examples, inflamed against vice, and in love with
virtue; for in all these ways a good play will stimulate the mind of
the hearer be he ever so boorish or dull; and of all impossibilities
the greatest is that a play endowed with all these qualities will not
entertain, satisfy, and please much more than one wanting in them,
like the greater number of those which are commonly acted now-a-days.
Nor are the poets who write them to be blamed for this; for some there
are among them who are perfectly well aware of their faults, and know
what they ought to do; but as plays have become a salable commodity,
they say, and with truth, that the actors will not buy them unless
they are after this fashion; and so the poet tries to adapt himself to
the requirements of the actor who is to pay him for his work. And that
this is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most
fertile wit of these kingdoms has written, with so much brilliancy, so
much grace and gaiety, such polished versification, such choice
language, such profound reflections, and in a word, so rich in
eloquence and elevation of style, that he has filled the world with
his fame; and yet, in consequence of his desire to suit the taste of
the actors, they have not all, as some of them have, come as near
perfection as they ought. Others write plays with such heedlessness
that, after they have been acted, the actors have to fly and abscond,
afraid of being punished, as they often have been, for having acted
something offensive to some king or other, or insulting to some noble
family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothing of, would be
removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person at the
capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only those
produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be acted
in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local
magistracy should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors
would take care to send their plays to the capital, and could act them
in safety, and those who write them would be more careful and take
more pains with their work, standing in awe of having to submit it to
the strict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good
plays would be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained;
as well the amusement of the people, as the credit of the wits of
Spain, the interest and safety of the actors, and the saving of
trouble in inflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some
other person were authorised to examine the newly written books of
chivalry, no doubt some would appear with all the perfections you have
described, enriching our language with the gracious and precious
treasure of eloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before
the light of the new ones that would come out for the harmless
entertainment, not merely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the
bow cannot be always bent, nor can weak human nature exist without
some lawful amusement." The canon and the curate had proceeded thus
far with their conversation, when the barber, coming forward, joined
them, and said to the curate, "This is the spot, senor licentiate,
that I said was a good one for fresh and plentiful pasture for the
oxen, while we take our noontide rest." "And so it seems," returned
the curate, and he told the canon what he proposed to do, on which he
too made up his mind to halt with them, attracted by the aspect of the
fair valley that lay before their eyes; and to enjoy it as well as the
conversation of the curate, to whom he had begun to take a fancy, and
also to learn more particulars about the doings of Don Quixote, he
desired some of his servants to go on to the inn, which was not far
distant, and fetch from it what eatables there might be for the whole
party, as he meant to rest for the afternoon where he was; to which
one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule, which by this time
ought to have reached the inn, carried provisions enough to make it
unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley. "In that
case," said the canon, "take all the beasts there, and bring the
sumpter mule back." While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that
he could speak to his master without having the curate and the barber,
of whom he had his suspicions, present all the time, approached the
cage in which Don Quixote was placed, and said, "Senor, to ease my
conscience I want to tell you the state of the case as to your
enchantment, and that is that these two here, with their faces
covered, are the curate of our village and the barber; and I suspect
they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this fashion, out
of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing famous
deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted,
but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want to ask you
one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you will
be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that you are
not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits." "Ask what thou wilt,
Sancho my son," returned Don Quixote, "for I will satisfy thee and
answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest, that these who
accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our neighbours and
acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to be those same
persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact, believe it not
on any account; what thou art to believe and think is that, if they
look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who have
enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy for
enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken those
of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee
into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape though
thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it to make
me uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence this evil
comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the barber
and curate of our village are here in company with us, and on the
other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no
power on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut
me in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment
is of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the
histories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted? So
thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what
thou sayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk. But touching thy
desire to ask me something, say on, and I will answer thee, though
thou shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning." "May
Our Lady be good to me!" said Sancho, lifting up his voice; "and is it
possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of brains
that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and that
malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than
enchantment? But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are
not enchanted. Now tell me, so may God deliver you from this
affliction, and so may you find yourself when you least expect it in
the arms of my lady Dulcinea-" "Leave off conjuring me," said Don
Quixote, "and ask what thou wouldst know; I have already told thee I
will answer with all possible precision." "That is what I want," said
Sancho; "and what I would know, and have you tell me, without adding
or leaving out anything, but telling the whole truth as one expects it
to be told, and as it is told, by all who profess arms, as your
worship professes them, under the title of knights-errant-" "I tell
thee I will not lie in any particular," said Don Quixote; "finish thy
question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations,
requirements, and precautions, Sancho." "Well, I rely on the goodness
and truth of my master," said Sancho; "and so, because it bears upon
what we are talking about, I would ask, speaking with all reverence,
whether since your worship has been shut up and, as you think,
enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire or inclination to go
anywhere, as the saying is?" "I do not understand 'going anywhere,'"
said Don Quixote; "explain thyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou
wouldst have me give an answer to the point." "Is it possible," said
Sancho, "that your worship does not understand 'going anywhere'? Why,
the schoolboys know that from the time they were babes. Well then, you
must know I mean have you had any desire to do what cannot be
avoided?" "Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "yes,
often, and even this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will
not go right." CHAPTER XLIX. WHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION
WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER DON QUIXOTE "Aha, I have
caught you," said Sancho; "this is what in my heart and soul I was
longing to know. Come now, senor, can you deny what is commonly said
around us, when a person is out of humour, 'I don't know what ails
so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives a
proper answer to any question; one would think he was enchanted'? From
which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or
sleep, or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of-that such
persons are enchanted; but not those that have the desire your worship
has, and drink when drink is given them, and eat when there is
anything to eat, and answer every question that is asked them." "What
thou sayest is true, Sancho," replied Don Quixote; "but I have already
told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may be that in
the course of time they have been changed one for another, and that
now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do,
though they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw
inferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am
enchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would
weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in
a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage,
defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need
and distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid
and protection." "Still for all that," replied Sancho, "I say that,
for your greater and fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your
worship were to try to get out of this prison (and I promise to do all
in my power to help, and even to take you out of it), and see if you
could once more mount your good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted
too, he is so melancholy and dejected; and then we might try our
chance in looking for adventures again; and if we have no luck there
will be time enough to go back to the cage; in which, on the faith of
a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut myself up along with your
worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be
able to carry out my plan." "I am content to do as thou sayest,
brother Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and when thou seest an opportunity
for effecting my release I will obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt
see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thy conception of my
misfortune." The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their
conversation till they reached the place where the curate, the canon,
and the barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The
carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about
the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not
enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like
his squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the
cage for a little; for if they did not let him out, he protested he
would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they kept
their distance. The canon took his hand, tied together as they both
were, and on his word and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced
beyond measure he was to find himself out of the cage. The first thing
he did was to stretch himself all over, and then he went to where
Rocinante was standing and giving him a couple of slaps on the
haunches said, "I still trust in God and in his blessed mother, O
flower and mirror of steeds, that we shall soon see ourselves, both of
us, as we wish to be, thou with thy master on thy back, and I mounted
upon thee, following the calling for which God sent me into the
world." And so saying, accompanied by Sancho, he withdrew to a retired
spot, from which he came back much relieved and more eager than ever
to put his squire's scheme into execution. The canon gazed at him,
wondering at the extraordinary nature of his madness, and that in all
his remarks and replies he should show such excellent sense, and only
lose his stirrups, as has been already said, when the subject of
chivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion, he said to him, as
they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival of the
provisions: "Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle
reading of books of chivalry can have had such an effect on your
worship as to upset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted,
and the like, all as far from the truth as falsehood itself is? How
can there be any human understanding that can persuade itself there
ever was all that infinity of Amadises in the world, or all that
multitude of famous knights, all those emperors of Trebizond, all
those Felixmartes of Hircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant,
and serpents, and monsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures, and
enchantments of every kind, and battles, and prodigious encounters,
splendid costumes, love-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll
dwarfs, love letters, billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and,
in a word, all that nonsense the books of chivalry contain? For
myself, I can only say that when I read them, so long as I do not stop
to think that they are all lies and frivolity, they give me a certain
amount of pleasure; but when I come to consider what they are, I fling
the very best of them at the wall, and would fling it into the fire if
there were one at hand, as richly deserving such punishment as cheats
and impostors out of the range of ordinary toleration, and as founders
of new sects and modes of life, and teachers that lead the ignorant
public to believe and accept as truth all the folly they contain. And
such is their audacity, they even dare to unsettle the wits of
gentlemen of birth and intelligence, as is shown plainly by the way
they have served your worship, when they have brought you to such a
pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and carried on an ox-cart
as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place to place to make money
by showing it. Come, Senor Don Quixote, have some compassion for
yourself, return to the bosom of common sense, and make use of the
liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you,
employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may
serve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour. And if, still
led away by your natural bent, you desire to read books of
achievements and of chivalry, read the Book of Judges in the Holy
Scriptures, for there you will find grand reality, and deeds as true
as they are heroic. Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a Caesar, Carthage
a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander, Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez,
Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a Diego
Garcia de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo a Garcilaso,
Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deeds will
entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them with delight
and wonder. Here, Senor Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of your
sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history, in
love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners, brave
without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of
God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am
informed, your worship derives your birth." Don Quixote listened with
the greatest attention to the canon's words, and when he found he had
finished, after regarding him for some time, he replied to him: "It
appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship's discourse is intended
to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in it; and as
it is my opinion that, unless heaven by some miracle brings home to
them the truth that there were and are, all the pains one takes will
be in vain (as experience has often proved to me), I will not now stop
to disabuse you of the error you share with the multitude. All I shall
do is to pray to heaven to deliver you from it, and show you how
beneficial and necessary knights-errant were in days of yore, and how
useful they would be in these days were they but in vogue; but now,
for the sins of the people, sloth and indolence, gluttony and luxury
are triumphant." "Our guest has broken out on our hands," said Don
Lorenzo to himself at this point; "but, for all that, he is a glorious
madman, and I should be a dull blockhead to doubt it." Here, being
summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close. Don Diego
asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the wits of
their guest. To which he replied, "All the doctors and clever scribes
in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness; he is a
madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals." They went in to
dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on the road he was
in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful, and tasty; but
what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence that reigned
throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian monastery. When the
cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, Don Quixote
earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for the
poetical tournament, to which he replied, "Not to be like those poets
who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when they
are not asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, for
which I do not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an
exercise of ingenuity." "A discerning friend of mine," said Don
Quixote, "was of opinion that no one ought to waste labour in glossing
verses; and the reason he gave was that the gloss can never come up to
the text, and that often or most frequently it wanders away from the
meaning and purpose aimed at in the glossed lines; and besides, that
the laws of the gloss were too strict, as they did not allow
interrogations, nor 'said he,' nor 'I say,' nor turning verbs into
nouns, or altering the construction, not to speak of other
restrictions and limitations that fetter gloss-writers, as you no
doubt know." "Verily, Senor Don Quixote," said Don Lorenzo, "I wish I
could catch your worship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you
slip through my fingers like an eel." "I don't understand what you
say, or mean by slipping," said Don Quixote. "I will explain myself
another time," said Don Lorenzo; "for the present pray attend to the
glossed verses and the gloss, which run thus: Could 'was' become an
'is' for me, Then would I ask no more than this. I ask what cannot be,
alas! That time should ever be, and then Come back to us, and be
again, No power on earth can bring to pass; For fleet of foot is he, I
wis, And idly, therefore, do we pray That what for aye hath left us
may Become for us the time that is. Perplexed, uncertain, to remain
'Twixt hope and fear, is death, not life; 'Twere better, sure, to end
the strife, And dying, seek release from pain. And yet, thought were
the best for me. Anon the thought aside I fling, And to the present
fondly cling, And dread the time that is to be." When Don Lorenzo had
finished reciting his gloss, Don Quixote stood up, and in a loud
voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he grasped Don Lorenzo's right
hand in his, "By the highest heavens, noble youth, but you are the
best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel, not by
Cyprus or by Gaeta--as a certain poet, God forgive him, said--but by
the Academies of Athens, if they still flourished, and by those that
flourish now, Paris, Bologna, Salamanca. Heaven grant that the judges
who rob you of the first prize--that Phoebus may pierce them with his
arrows, and the Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors.
Repeat me some of your long-measure verses, senor, if you will be so
good, for I want thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius." Is
there any need to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised
by Don Quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power of
flattery, how far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of
thy pleasant jurisdiction! Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he
complied with Don Quixote's request and entreaty, and repeated to him
this sonnet on the fable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe. SONNET The
lovely maid, she pierces now the wall; Heart-pierced by her young
Pyramus doth lie; And Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly, A
chink to view so wondrous great and small. There silence speaketh, for
no voice at all Can pass so strait a strait; but love will ply Where
to all other power 'twere vain to try; For love will find a way
whate'er befall. Impatient of delay, with reckless pace The rash maid
wins the fatal spot where she Sinks not in lover's arms but death's
embrace. So runs the strange tale, how the lovers twain One sword, one
sepulchre, one memory, Slays, and entombs, and brings to life again.
"Blessed be God," said Don Quixote when he had heard Don Lorenzo's
sonnet, "that among the hosts there are of irritable poets I have
found one consummate one, which, senor, the art of this sonnet proves
to me that you are!" For four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously
entertained in Don Diego's house, at the end of which time he asked
his permission to depart, telling him he thanked him for the kindness
and hospitality he had received in his house, but that, as it did not
become knights-errant to give themselves up for long to idleness and
luxury, he was anxious to fulfill the duties of his calling in seeking
adventures, of which he was informed there was an abundance in that
neighbourhood, where he hoped to employ his time until the day came
round for the jousts at Saragossa, for that was his proper
destination; and that, first of all, he meant to enter the cave of
Montesinos, of which so many marvellous things were reported all
through the country, and at the same time to investigate and explore
the origin and true source of the seven lakes commonly called the
lakes of Ruidera. Don Diego and his son commended his laudable
resolution, and bade him furnish himself with all he wanted from their
house and belongings, as they would most gladly be of service to him;
which, indeed, his personal worth and his honourable profession made
incumbent upon them. The day of his departure came at length, as
welcome to Don Quixote as it was sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza,
who was very well satisfied with the abundance of Don Diego's house,
and objected to return to the starvation of the woods and wilds and
the short-commons of his ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he
filled and packed with what he considered needful. On taking leave,
Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, "I know not whether I have told you
already, but if I have I tell you once more, that if you wish to spare
yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the inaccessible summit of the
temple of fame, you have nothing to do but to let yourselves be guided
by what he says, and on my head be it if it is wrong. Besides which,
you have been told that it is folly to take offence at merely hearing
a bray. I remember when I was a boy I brayed as often as I had a
fancy, without anyone hindering me, and so elegantly and naturally
that when I brayed all the asses in the town would bray; but I was
none the less for that the son of my parents who were greatly
respected; and though I was envied because of the gift by more than
one of the high and mighty ones of the town, I did not care two
farthings for it; and that you may see I am telling the truth, wait a
bit and listen, for this art, like swimming, once learnt is never
forgotten;" and then, taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so
vigorously that all the valleys around rang again. One of those,
however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them, lifted up
a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with it that
Sancho dropped helpless to the ground. Don Quixote, seeing him so
roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand,
but so many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge
him. Far from it, finding a shower of stones rained upon him, and
crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled Rocinante
round and, as fast as his best gallop could take him, fled from the
midst of them, commending himself to God with all his heart to deliver
him out of this peril, in dread every step of some ball coming in at
his back and coming out at his breast, and every minute drawing his
breath to see whether it had gone from him. The members of the band,
however, were satisfied with seeing him take to flight, and did not
fire on him. They put up Sancho, scarcely restored to his senses, on
his ass, and let him go after his master; not that he was sufficiently
in his wits to guide the beast, but Dapple followed the footsteps of
Rocinante, from whom he could not remain a moment separated. Don
Quixote having got some way off looked back, and seeing Sancho coming,
waited for him, as he perceived that no one followed him. The men of
the troop stood their ground till night, and as the enemy did not come
out to battle, they returned to their town exulting; and had they been
aware of the ancient custom of the Greeks, they would have erected a
trophy on the spot. CHAPTER XXVIII. OF MATTERS THAT BENENGELI SAYS HE
WHO READS THEM WILL KNOW, IF HE READS THEM WITH ATTENTION CHAPTER XXIX
OF THE FAMOUS ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED BARK CHAPTER XXX OF DON
QUIXOTE'S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR HUNTRESS CHAPTER XXXI WHICH TREATS OF
MANY AND GREAT MATTERS Supreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt
at seeing himself, as it seemed, an established favourite with the
duchess, for he looked forward to finding in her castle what he had
found in Don Diego's house and in Basilio's; he was always fond of
good living, and always seized by the forelock any opportunity of
feasting himself whenever it presented itself. The history informs us,
then, that before they reached the country house or castle, the duke
went on in advance and instructed all his servants how they were to
treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he came up to the castle gates
with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries, clad in what they call
morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to their feet, hastened
out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before he saw or heard
them, said to him, "Your highness should go and take my lady the
duchess off her horse." Don Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of
compliments followed between the two over the matter; but in the end
the duchess's determination carried the day, and she refused to get
down or dismount from her palfrey except in the arms of the duke,
saying she did not consider herself worthy to impose so unnecessary a
burden on so great a knight. At length the duke came out to take her
down, and as they entered a spacious court two fair damsels came
forward and threw over Don Quixote's shoulders a large mantle of the
finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the galleries of the
court were lined with the men-servants and women-servants of the
household, crying, "Welcome, flower and cream of knight-errantry!"
while all or most of them flung pellets filled with scented water over
Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which Don Quixote was
greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he thoroughly
felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality and not
merely in fancy, now that he saw himself treated in the same way as he
had read of such knights being treated in days of yore. Sancho,
deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered the castle, but
feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass alone, he
approached a respectable duenna who had come out with the rest to
receive the duchess, and in a low voice he said to her, "Senora
Gonzalez, or however your grace may be called-" "I am called Dona
Rodriguez de Grijalba," replied the duenna; "what is your will,
brother?" To which Sancho made answer, "I should be glad if your
worship would do me the favour to go out to the castle gate, where you
will find a grey ass of mine; make them, if you please, put him in the
stable, or put him there yourself, for the poor little beast is rather
easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone at all." "If the master
is as wise as the man," said the duenna, "we have got a fine bargain.
Be off with you, brother, and bad luck to you and him who brought you
here; go, look after your ass, for we, the duennas of this house, are
not used to work of that sort." "Well then, in troth," returned
Sancho, "I have heard my master, who is the very treasure-finder of
stories, telling the story of Lancelot when he came from Britain, say
that ladies waited upon him and duennas upon his hack; and, if it
comes to my ass, I wouldn't change him for Senor Lancelot's hack." "If
you are a jester, brother," said the duenna, "keep your drolleries for
some place where they'll pass muster and be paid for; for you'll get
nothing from me but a fig." "At any rate, it will be a very ripe one,"
said Sancho, "for you won't lose the trick in years by a point too
little." "Son of a bitch," said the duenna, all aglow with anger,
"whether I'm old or not, it's with God I have to reckon, not with you,
you garlic-stuffed scoundrel!" and she said it so loud, that the
duchess heard it, and turning round and seeing the duenna in such a
state of excitement, and her eyes flaming so, asked whom she was
wrangling with. "With this good fellow here," said the duenna, "who
has particularly requested me to go and put an ass of his that is at
the castle gate into the stable, holding it up to me as an example
that they did the same I don't know where--that some ladies waited on
one Lancelot, and duennas on his hack; and what is more, to wind up
with, he called me old." "That," said the duchess, "I should have
considered the greatest affront that could be offered me;" and
addressing Sancho, she said to him, "You must know, friend Sancho,
that Dona Rodriguez is very youthful, and that she wears that hood
more for authority and custom sake than because of her years." "May
all the rest of mine be unlucky," said Sancho, "if I meant it that
way; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass is so great,
and I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-hearted person
than the lady Dona Rodriguez." Don Quixote, who was listening, said to
him, "Is this proper conversation for the place, Sancho?" "Senor,"
replied Sancho, "every one must mention what he wants wherever he may
be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him here; if I had
thought of him in the stable I would have spoken there." On which the
duke observed, "Sancho is quite right, and there is no reason at all
to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to his heart's content,
and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated like himself." While
this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, was proceeding,
they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into a chamber
hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved him of
his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared and
instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and how
they were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believe they
were treating him like a knight-errant. When his armour was removed,
there stood Don Quixote in his tight-fitting breeches and chamois
doublet, lean, lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be kissing
each other inside; such a figure, that if the damsels waiting on him
had not taken care to check their merriment (which was one of the
particular directions their master and mistress had given them), they
would have burst with laughter. They asked him to let himself be
stripped that they might put a shirt on him, but he would not on any
account, saying that modesty became knights-errant just as much as
valour. However, he said they might give the shirt to Sancho; and
shutting himself in with him in a room where there was a sumptuous
bed, he undressed and put on the shirt; and then, finding himself
alone with Sancho, he said to him, "Tell me, thou new-fledged buffoon
and old booby, dost thou think it right to offend and insult a duenna
so deserving of reverence and respect as that one just now? Was that a
time to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these noble personages
likely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat their owners in
such elegant style? For God's sake, Sancho, restrain thyself, and
don't show the thread so as to let them see what a coarse, boorish
texture thou art of. Remember, sinner that thou art, the master is the
more esteemed the more respectable and well-bred his servants are; and
that one of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men
is that they have servants as good as themselves to wait on them. Dost
thou not see--shortsighted being that thou art, and unlucky mortal
that I am!--that if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dull
blockhead, they will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler? Nay,
nay, Sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of these
stumbling-blocks; for he who falls into the way of being a chatterbox
and droll, drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he trips;
bridle thy tongue, consider and weigh thy words before they escape thy
mouth, and bear in mind we are now in quarters whence, by God's help,
and the strength of my arm, we shall come forth mightily advanced in
fame and fortune." Sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep
his mouth shut, and to bite off his tongue before he uttered a word
that was not altogether to the purpose and well considered, and told
him he might make his mind easy on that point, for it should never be
discovered through him what they were. Don Quixote dressed himself,
put on his baldric with his sword, threw the scarlet mantle over his
shoulders, placed on his head a montera of green satin that the
damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out into the large
room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double file, the same
number on each side, all with the appliances for washing the hands,
which they presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies.
Then came twelve pages, together with the seneschal, to lead him to
dinner, as his hosts were already waiting for him. They placed him in
the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted
him into another room, where there was a sumptuous table laid with but
four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room
to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who
rule noblemen's houses; one of those who, not being born magnates
themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to behave as
such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk measured
by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they try to
introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into meanness.
One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came
out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote. A vast number of
polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote
between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed
Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the
entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it. The
ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess
those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with
amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these
illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that
had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his
seat at the head of the table, he said, "If your worship will give me
leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about
this matter of seats." The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote
trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish.
Sancho glanced at him, and guessing his thoughts, said, "Don't be
afraid of my going astray, senor, or saying anything that won't be pat
to the purpose; I haven't forgotten the advice your worship gave me
just now about talking much or little, well or ill." "I have no
recollection of anything, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "say what thou
wilt, only say it quickly." "Well then," said Sancho, "what I am going
to say is so true that my master Don Quixote, who is here present,
will keep me from lying." "Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care,
Sancho," said Don Quixote, "for I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat,
my wits are so confused and upset." With this permission Sancho said
to the peasants who stood clustered round him, waiting with open
mouths for the decision to come from his, "Brothers, what the fat man
requires is not in reason, nor has it a shadow of justice in it;
because, if it be true, as they say, that the challenged may choose
the weapons, the other has no right to choose such as will prevent and
keep him from winning. My decision, therefore, is that the fat
challenger prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and take
eleven stone of his flesh off his body, here or there, as he pleases,
and as suits him best; and being in this way reduced to nine stone
weight, he will make himself equal and even with nine stone of his
opponent, and they will be able to run on equal terms." "By all that's
good," said one of the peasants as he heard Sancho's decision, "but
the gentleman has spoken like a saint, and given judgment like a
canon! But I'll be bound the fat man won't part with an ounce of his
flesh, not to say eleven stone." "The best plan will be for them not
to run," said another, "so that neither the thin man break down under
the weight, nor the fat one strip himself of his flesh; let half the
wager be spent in wine, and let's take these gentlemen to the tavern
where there's the best, and 'over me be the cloak when it rains." "I
thank you, sirs," said Don Quixote; "but I cannot stop for an instant,
for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem
discourteous and to travel apace;" and spurring Rocinante he pushed
on, leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his own
strange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they
took Sancho to be; and another of them observed, "If the servant is so
clever, what must the master be? I'll bet, if they are going to
Salamanca to study, they'll come to be alcaldes of the Court in a
trice; for it's a mere joke--only to read and read, and have interest
and good luck; and before a man knows where he is he finds himself
with a staff in his hand or a mitre on his head." That night master
and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and the next day as
they were pursuing their journey they saw coming towards them a man on
foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked staff in his
hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he came close to
Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running came up to him, and
embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no higher, exclaimed
with evident pleasure, "O Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what
happiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows
your worship is coming back to his castle, for he is still there with
my lady the duchess!" "I do not recognise you, friend," said Don
Quixote, "nor do I know who you are, unless you tell me." "I am
Tosilos, my lord the duke's lacquey, Senor Don Quixote," replied the
courier; "he who refused to fight your worship about marrying the
daughter of Dona Rodriguez." "God bless me!" exclaimed Don Quixote;
"is it possible that you are the one whom mine enemies the enchanters
changed into the lacquey you speak of in order to rob me of the honour
of that battle?" "Nonsense, good sir!" said the messenger; "there was
no enchantment or transformation at all; I entered the lists just as
much lacquey Tosilos as I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought
to marry without fighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my
scheme had a very different result, for as soon as your worship had
left the castle my lord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick
given me for having acted contrary to the orders he gave me before
engaging in the combat; and the end of the whole affair is that the
girl has become a nun, and Dona Rodriguez has gone back to Castile,
and I am now on my way to Barcelona with a packet of letters for the
viceroy which my master is sending him. If your worship would like a
drop, sound though warm, I have a gourd here full of the best, and
some scraps of Tronchon cheese that will serve as a provocative and
wakener of your thirst if so be it is asleep." "I take the offer,"
said Sancho; "no more compliments about it; pour out, good Tosilos, in
spite of all the enchanters in the Indies." "Thou art indeed the
greatest glutton in the world, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and the
greatest booby on earth, not to be able to see that this courier is
enchanted and this Tosilos a sham one; stop with him and take thy
fill; I will go on slowly and wait for thee to come up with me." The
lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and
taking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on
the green grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the
contents of the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they
licked the wrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese.
Said Tosilos to Sancho, "Beyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this master
of thine ought to be a madman." "Ought!" said Sancho; "he owes no man
anything; he pays for everything, particularly when the coin is
madness. I see it plain enough, and I tell him so plain enough; but
what's the use? especially now that it is all over with him, for here
he is beaten by the Knight of the White Moon." Tosilos begged him to
explain what had happened him, but Sancho replied that it would not be
good manners to leave his master waiting for him; and that some other
day if they met there would be time enough for that; and then getting
up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the crumbs out of his
beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and bidding adieu to Tosilos
left him and rejoined his master, who was waiting for him under the
shade of a tree. CHAPTER LXVII. OF THE RESOLUTION DON QUIXOTE FORMED
TO TURN SHEPHERD AND TAKE TO A LIFE IN THE FIELDS WHILE THE YEAR FOR
WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIS WORD WAS RUNNING ITS COURSE; WITH OTHER EVENTS
TRULY DELECTABLE AND HAPPY If a multitude of reflections used to
harass Don Quixote before he had been overthrown, a great many more
harassed him since his fall. He was under the shade of a tree, as has
been said, and there, like flies on honey, thoughts came crowding upon
him and stinging him. Some of them turned upon the disenchantment of
Dulcinea, others upon the life he was about to lead in his enforced
retirement. Sancho came up and spoke in high praise of the generous
disposition of the lacquey Tosilos. "Is it possible, Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "that thou dost still think that he yonder is a real lacquey?
Apparently it has escaped thy memory that thou hast seen Dulcinea
turned and transformed into a peasant wench, and the Knight of the
Mirrors into the bachelor Carrasco; all the work of the enchanters
that persecute me. But tell me now, didst thou ask this Tosilos, as
thou callest him, what has become of Altisidora, did she weep over my
absence, or has she already consigned to oblivion the love thoughts
that used to afflict her when I was present?" "The thoughts that I
had," said Sancho, "were not such as to leave time for asking fool's
questions. Body o' me, senor! is your worship in a condition now to
inquire into other people's thoughts, above all love thoughts?" "Look
ye, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "there is a great difference between
what is done out of love and what is done out of gratitude. A knight
may very possibly be proof against love; but it is impossible,
strictly speaking, for him to be ungrateful. Altisidora, to all
appearance, loved me truly; she gave me the three kerchiefs thou
knowest of; she wept at my departure, she cursed me, she abused me,
casting shame to the winds she bewailed herself in public; all signs
that she adored me; for the wrath of lovers always ends in curses. I
had no hopes to give her, nor treasures to offer her, for mine are
given to Dulcinea, and the treasures of knights-errant are like those
of the fairies,' illusory and deceptive; all I can give her is the
place in my memory I keep for her, without prejudice, however, to that
which I hold devoted to Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thy
remissness in whipping thyself and scourging that flesh--would that I
saw it eaten by wolves--which would rather keep itself for the worms
than for the relief of that poor lady." "Senor," replied Sancho, "if
the truth is to be told, nobody copied out the letter for me, for I
carried no letter at all." "It is as thou sayest," said Don Quixote,
"for the note-book in which I wrote it I found in my own possession
two days after thy departure, which gave me very great vexation, as I
knew not what thou wouldst do on finding thyself without any letter;
and I made sure thou wouldst return from the place where thou didst
first miss it." "So I should have done," said Sancho, "if I had not
got it by heart when your worship read it to me, so that I repeated it
to a sacristan, who copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly
that he said in all the days of his life, though he had read many a
letter of excommunication, he had never seen or read so pretty a
letter as that." "And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?"
said Don Quixote. "No, senor," replied Sancho, "for as soon as I had
repeated it, seeing there was no further use for it, I set about
forgetting it; and if I recollect any of it, it is that about
'Scrubbing,'I mean to say 'Sovereign Lady,' and the end 'Yours till
death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.' And it will be no great
matter if it is in some other person's hand, for as well as I
recollect Dulcinea can neither read nor write, nor in the whole course
of her life has she seen handwriting or letter of mine, for my love
and hers have been always platonic, not going beyond a modest look,
and even that so seldom that I can safely swear I have not seen her
four times in all these twelve years I have been loving her more than
the light of these eyes that the earth will one day devour; and
perhaps even of those four times she has not once perceived that I was
looking at her: such is the retirement and seclusion in which her
father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her mother Aldonza Nogales have brought
her up." "So, so!" said Sancho; "Lorenzo Corchuelo's daughter is the
lady Dulcinea del Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?" "She it
is," said Don Quixote, "and she it is that is worthy to be lady of the
whole universe." "I know her well," said Sancho, "and let me tell you
she can fling a crowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town.
Giver of all good! but she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one,
and fit to be helpmate to any knight-errant that is or is to be, who
may make her his lady: the whoreson wench, what sting she has and what
a voice! I can tell you one day she posted herself on the top of the
belfry of the village to call some labourers of theirs that were in a
ploughed field of her father's, and though they were better than half
a league off they heard her as well as if they were at the foot of the
tower; and the best of her is that she is not a bit prudish, for she
has plenty of affability, and jokes with everybody, and has a grin and
a jest for everything. So, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, I say
you not only may and ought to do mad freaks for her sake, but you have
a good right to give way to despair and hang yourself; and no one who
knows of it but will say you did well, though the devil should take
you; and I wish I were on my road already, simply to see her, for it
is many a day since I saw her, and she must be altered by this time,
for going about the fields always, and the sun and the air spoil
women's looks greatly. But I must own the truth to your worship, Senor
Don Quixote; until now I have been under a great mistake, for I
believed truly and honestly that the lady Dulcinea must be some
princess your worship was in love with, or some person great enough to
deserve the rich presents you have sent her, such as the Biscayan and
the galley slaves, and many more no doubt, for your worship must have
won many victories in the time when I was not yet your squire. But all
things considered, what good can it do the lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I
mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote's letter to
her, for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how
did he dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her
sifting wheat, the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so
much to the prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea's good name, a thing
that is not at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good
squire?" At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up
from his chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his
finger on his lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings;
and this done, he came back to his seat and said, "Now, senora, that I
have seen that there is no one except the bystanders listening to us
on the sly, I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask
me, without fear or dread. And the first thing I have got to say is,
that for my own part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad,
though sometimes he says things that, to my mind, and indeed
everybody's that listens to him, are so wise, and run in such a
straight furrow, that Satan himself could not have said them better;
but for all that, really, and beyond all question, it's my firm belief
he is cracked. Well, then, as this is clear to my mind, I can venture
to make him believe things that have neither head nor tail, like that
affair of the answer to the letter, and that other of six or eight
days ago, which is not yet in history, that is to say, the affair of
the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made him believe she is
enchanted, though there's no more truth in it than over the hills of
Ubeda." The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or
deception, so Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened,
and his hearers were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the
duchess said, "In consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a
doubt starts up in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my
ear that says, 'If Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho
Panza his squire knows it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows
him, and goes trusting to his empty promises, there can be no doubt he
must be still madder and sillier than his master; and that being so,
it will be cast in your teeth, senora duchess, if you give the said
Sancho an island to govern; for how will he who does not know how to
take advantage of luck when it comes to him, has no right to complain
if it gives him the go-by; and now that it is knocking at our door, it
will not do to shut it out; let us go with the favouring breeze that
blows upon us." It is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower
down, that made the translator of the history say he considered this
chapter apocryphal. "Don't you see, you animal," continued Sancho,
"that it will be well for me to drop into some profitable government
that will lift us out of the mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I
like; and you yourself will find yourself called 'Dona Teresa Panza,'
and sitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in
spite and in defiance of all the born ladies of the town? No, stay as
you are, growing neither greater nor less, like a tapestry figure--Let
us say no more about it, for Sanchica shall be a countess, say what
you will." "Are you sure of all you say, husband?" replied Teresa.
"Well, for all that, I am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter
will be her ruin. You do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of
her, but I can tell you it will not be with my will and consent. I was
always a lover of equality, brother, and I can't bear to see people
give themselves airs without any right. They called me Teresa at my
baptism, a plain, simple name, without any additions or tags or
fringes of Dons or Donas; Cascajo was my father's name, and as I am
your wife, I am called Teresa Panza, though by right I ought to be
called Teresa Cascajo; but 'kings go where laws like,' and I am
content with this name without having the 'Don' put on top of it to
make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don't want to make
people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess or
governor's wife; for they will say at once, 'See what airs the slut
gives herself! Only yesterday she was always spinning flax, and used
to go to mass with the tail of her petticoat over her head instead of
a mantle, and there she goes to-day in a hooped gown with her broaches
and airs, as if we didn't know her!' If God keeps me in my seven
senses, or five, or whatever number I have, I am not going to bring
myself to such a pass; go you, brother, and be a government or an
island man, and swagger as much as you like; for by the soul of my
mother, neither my daughter nor I are going to stir a step from our
village; a respectable woman should have a broken leg and keep at
home;" it would be a nice thing if, after people had been at the
trouble of coming to look for him on business, the governor were to be
away in the forest enjoying himself; the government would go on badly
in that fashion. By my faith, senor, hunting and amusements are more
fit for idlers than for governors; what I intend to amuse myself with
is playing all fours at Eastertime, and bowls on Sundays and holidays;
for these huntings don't suit my condition or agree with my
conscience." "God grant it may turn out so," said the duke; "because
it's a long step from saying to doing." "Be that as it may," said
Sancho, "'pledges don't distress a good payer,' and 'he whom God helps
does better than he who gets up early,' and 'it's the tripes that
carry the feet and not the feet the tripes;' I mean to say that if God
gives me help and I do my duty honestly, no doubt I'll govern better
than a gerfalcon. Nay, let them only put a finger in my mouth, and
they'll see whether I can bite or not." "The curse of God and all his
saints upon thee, thou accursed Sancho!" exclaimed Don Quixote; "when
will the day come--as I have often said to thee--when I shall hear
thee make one single coherent, rational remark without proverbs? Pray,
your highnesses, leave this fool alone, for he will grind your souls
between, not to say two, but two thousand proverbs, dragged in as much
in season, and as much to the purpose as--may God grant as much health
to him, or to me if I want to listen to them!" "Sancho Panza's
proverbs," said the duchess, "though more in number than the Greek
Commander's, are not therefore less to be esteemed for the conciseness
of the maxims. For my own part, I can say they give me more pleasure
than others that may be better brought in and more seasonably
introduced." In pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of
the tent into the wood, and the day was spent in visiting some of the
posts and hiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as
brilliantly or tranquilly as might have been expected at the season,
for it was then midsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that
greatly aided the project of the duke and duchess; and thus, as night
began to fall, and a little after twilight set in, suddenly the whole
wood on all four sides seemed to be on fire, and shortly after, here,
there, on all sides, a vast number of trumpets and other military
instruments were heard, as if several troops of cavalry were passing
through the wood. The blaze of the fire and the noise of the warlike
instruments almost blinded the eyes and deafened the ears of those
that stood by, and indeed of all who were in the wood. Then there were
heard repeated lelilies after the fashion of the Moors when they rush
to battle; trumpets and clarions brayed, drums beat, fifes played, so
unceasingly and so fast that he could not have had any senses who did
not lose them with the confused din of so many instruments. The duke
was astounded, the duchess amazed, Don Quixote wondering, Sancho Panza
trembling, and indeed, even they who were aware of the cause were
frightened. In their fear, silence fell upon them, and a postillion,
in the guise of a demon, passed in front of them, blowing, in lieu of
a bugle, a huge hollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse note. "Ho
there! brother courier," cried the duke, "who are you? Where are you
going? What troops are these that seem to be passing through the
wood?" To which the courier replied in a harsh, discordant voice, "I
am the devil; I am in search of Don Quixote of La Mancha; those who
are coming this way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on
a triumphal car the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso; she comes under
enchantment, together with the gallant Frenchman Montesinos, to give
instructions to Don Quixote as to how, she the said lady, may be
disenchanted." "If you were the devil, as you say and as your
appearance indicates," said the duke, "you would have known the said
knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, for you have him here before you."
"By God and upon my conscience," said the devil, "I never observed it,
for my mind is occupied with so many different things that I was
forgetting the main thing I came about." "This demon must be an honest
fellow and a good Christian," said Sancho; "for if he wasn't he
wouldn't swear by God and his conscience; I feel sure now there must
be good souls even in hell itself." Without dismounting, the demon
then turned to Don Quixote and said, "The unfortunate but valiant
knight Montesinos sends me to thee, the Knight of the Lions (would
that I saw thee in their claws), bidding me tell thee to wait for him
wherever I may find thee, as he brings with him her whom they call
Dulcinea del Toboso, that he may show thee what is needful in order to
disenchant her; and as I came for no more I need stay no longer;
demons of my sort be with thee, and good angels with these gentles;"
and so saying he blew his huge horn, turned about and went off without
waiting for a reply from anyone. They all felt fresh wonder, but
particularly Sancho and Don Quixote; Sancho to see how, in defiance of
the truth, they would have it that Dulcinea was enchanted; Don Quixote
because he could not feel sure whether what had happened to him in the
cave of Montesinos was true or not; and as he was deep in these
cogitations the duke said to him, "Do you mean to wait, Senor Don
Quixote?" "Why not?" replied he; "here will I wait, fearless and firm,
though all hell should come to attack me." "Well then, if I see
another devil or hear another horn like the last, I'll wait here as
much as in Flanders," said Sancho. Night now closed in more
completely, and many lights began to flit through the wood, just as
those fiery exhalations from the earth, that look like shooting-stars
to our eyes, flit through the heavens; a frightful noise, too, was
heard, like that made by the solid wheels the ox-carts usually have,
by the harsh, ceaseless creaking of which, they say, the bears and
wolves are put to flight, if there happen to be any where they are
passing. In addition to all this commotion, there came a further
disturbance to increase the tumult, for now it seemed as if in truth,
on all four sides of the wood, four encounters or battles were going
on at the same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a
terrible cannonade, in another numberless muskets were being
discharged, the shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand,
and farther away the Moorish lelilies were raised again and again. In
a word, the bugles, the horns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums,
the cannon, the musketry, and above all the tremendous noise of the
carts, all made up together a din so confused and terrific that Don
Quixote had need to summon up all his courage to brave it; but
Sancho's gave way, and he fell fainting on the skirt of the duchess's
robe, who let him lie there and promptly bade them throw water in his
face. This was done, and he came to himself by the time that one of
the carts with the creaking wheels reached the spot. It was drawn by
four plodding oxen all covered with black housings; on each horn they
had fixed a large lighted wax taper, and on the top of the cart was
constructed a raised seat, on which sat a venerable old man with a
beard whiter than the very snow, and so long that it fell below his
waist; he was dressed in a long robe of black buckram; for as the cart
was thickly set with a multitude of candles it was easy to make out
everything that was on it. Leading it were two hideous demons, also
clad in buckram, with countenances so frightful that Sancho, having
once seen them, shut his eyes so as not to see them again. As soon as
the cart came opposite the spot the old man rose from his lofty seat,
and standing up said in a loud voice, "I am the sage Lirgandeo," and
without another word the cart then passed on. Behind it came another
of the same form, with another aged man enthroned, who, stopping the
cart, said in a voice no less solemn than that of the first, "I am the
sage Alquife, the great friend of Urganda the Unknown," and passed on.
Then another cart came by at the same pace, but the occupant of the
throne was not old like the others, but a man stalwart and robust, and
of a forbidding countenance, who as he came up said in a voice far
hoarser and more devilish, "I am the enchanter Archelaus, the mortal
enemy of Amadis of Gaul and all his kindred," and then passed on.
Having gone a short distance the three carts halted and the monotonous
noise of their wheels ceased, and soon after they heard another, not
noise, but sound of sweet, harmonious music, of which Sancho was very
glad, taking it to be a good sign; and said he to the duchess, from
whom he did not stir a step, or for a single instant, "Senora, where
there's music there can't be mischief." "Nor where there are lights
and it is bright," said the duchess; to which Sancho replied, "Fire
gives light, and it's bright where there are bonfires, as we see by
those that are all round us and perhaps may burn us; but music is a
sign of mirth and merrymaking." "That remains to be seen," said Don
Quixote, who was listening to all that passed; and he was right, as is
shown in the following chapter. CHAPTER XXXV. WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE
INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO DON QUIXOTE TOUCHING THE DISENCHANTMENT OF
DULCINEA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MARVELLOUS INCIDENTS They saw advancing
towards them, to the sound of this pleasing music, what they call a
triumphal car, drawn by six grey mules with white linen housings, on
each of which was mounted a penitent, robed also in white, with a
large lighted wax taper in his hand. The car was twice or, perhaps,
three times as large as the former ones, and in front and on the sides
stood twelve more penitents, all as white as snow and all with lighted
tapers, a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder; and on a raised
throne was seated a nymph draped in a multitude of silver-tissue veils
with an embroidery of countless gold spangles glittering all over
them, that made her appear, if not richly, at least brilliantly,
apparelled. She had her face covered with thin transparent sendal, the
texture of which did not prevent the fair features of a maiden from
being distinguished, while the numerous lights made it possible to
judge of her beauty and of her years, which seemed to be not less than
seventeen but not to have yet reached twenty. Beside her was a figure
in a robe of state, as they call it, reaching to the feet, while the
head was covered with a black veil. But the instant the car was
opposite the duke and duchess and Don Quixote the music of the
clarions ceased, and then that of the lutes and harps on the car, and
the figure in the robe rose up, and flinging it apart and removing the
veil from its face, disclosed to their eyes the shape of Death itself,
fleshless and hideous, at which sight Don Quixote felt uneasy, Sancho
frightened, and the duke and duchess displayed a certain trepidation.
Having risen to its feet, this living death, in a sleepy voice and
with a tongue hardly awake, held forth as follows: I am that Merlin
who the legends say The devil had for father, and the lie Hath
gathered credence with the lapse of time. Of magic prince, of
Zoroastric lore Monarch and treasurer, with jealous eye I view the
efforts of the age to hide The gallant deeds of doughty errant
knights, Who are, and ever have been, dear to me. Enchanters and
magicians and their kind Are mostly hard of heart; not so am I; For
mine is tender, soft, compassionate, And its delight is doing good to
all. In the dim caverns of the gloomy Dis, Where, tracing mystic lines
and characters, My soul abideth now, there came to me The sorrow-laden
plaint of her, the fair, The peerless Dulcinea del Toboso. I knew of
her enchantment and her fate, From high-born dame to peasant wench
transformed And touched with pity, first I turned the leaves Of
countless volumes of my devilish craft, And then, in this grim grisly
skeleton Myself encasing, hither have I come To show where lies the
fitting remedy To give relief in such a piteous case. O thou, the
pride and pink of all that wear The adamantine steel! O shining light,
O beacon, polestar, path and guide of all Who, scorning slumber and
the lazy down, Adopt the toilsome life of bloodstained arms! To thee,
great hero who all praise transcends, La Mancha's lustre and Iberia's
star, Don Quixote, wise as brave, to thee I say-- For peerless
Dulcinea del Toboso Her pristine form and beauty to regain, 'T is
needful that thy esquire Sancho shall, On his own sturdy buttocks
bared to heaven, Three thousand and three hundred lashes lay, And that
they smart and sting and hurt him well. Thus have the authors of her
woe resolved. And this is, gentles, wherefore I have come. "By all
that's good," exclaimed Sancho at this, "I'll just as soon give myself
three stabs with a dagger as three, not to say three thousand, lashes.
The devil take such a way of disenchanting! I don't see what my
backside has got to do with enchantments. By God, if Senor Merlin has
not found out some other way of disenchanting the lady Dulcinea del
Toboso, she may go to her grave enchanted." "But I'll take you, Don
Clown stuffed with garlic," said Don Quixote, "and tie you to a tree
as naked as when your mother brought you forth, and give you, not to
say three thousand three hundred, but six thousand six hundred lashes,
and so well laid on that they won't be got rid of if you try three
thousand three hundred times; don't answer me a word or I'll tear your
soul out." On hearing this Merlin said, "That will not do, for the
lashes worthy Sancho has to receive must be given of his own free will
and not by force, and at whatever time he pleases, for there is no
fixed limit assigned to him; but it is permitted him, if he likes to
commute by half the pain of this whipping, to let them be given by the
hand of another, though it may be somewhat weighty." "Not a hand, my
own or anybody else's, weighty or weighable, shall touch me," said
Sancho. "Was it I that gave birth to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso,
that my backside is to pay for the sins of her eyes? My master,
indeed, that's a part of her--for, he's always calling her 'my life'
and 'my soul,' and his stay and prop--may and ought to whip himself
for her and take all the trouble required for her disenchantment. But
for me to whip myself! Abernuncio!" As soon as Sancho had done
speaking the nymph in silver that was at the side of Merlin's ghost
stood up, and removing the thin veil from her face disclosed one that
seemed to all something more than exceedingly beautiful; and with a
masculine freedom from embarrassment and in a voice not very like a
lady's, addressing Sancho directly, said, "Thou wretched squire, soul
of a pitcher, heart of a cork tree, with bowels of flint and pebbles;
if, thou impudent thief, they bade thee throw thyself down from some
lofty tower; if, enemy of mankind, they asked thee to swallow a dozen
of toads, two of lizards, and three of adders; if they wanted thee to
slay thy wife and children with a sharp murderous scimitar, it would
be no wonder for thee to show thyself stubborn and squeamish. But to
make a piece of work about three thousand three hundred lashes, what
every poor little charity-boy gets every month--it is enough to amaze,
astonish, astound the compassionate bowels of all who hear it, nay,
all who come to hear it in the course of time. Turn, O miserable,
hard-hearted animal, turn, I say, those timorous owl's eyes upon these
of mine that are compared to radiant stars, and thou wilt see them
weeping trickling streams and rills, and tracing furrows, tracks, and
paths over the fair fields of my cheeks. Let it move thee, crafty,
ill-conditioned monster, to see my blooming youth--still in its teens,
for I am not yet twenty--wasting and withering away beneath the husk
of a rude peasant wench; and if I do not appear in that shape now, it
is a special favour Senor Merlin here has granted me, to the sole end
that my beauty may soften thee; for the tears of beauty in distress
turn rocks into cotton and tigers into ewes. Lay on to that hide of
thine, thou great untamed brute, rouse up thy lusty vigour that only
urges thee to eat and eat, and set free the softness of my flesh, the
gentleness of my nature, and the fairness of my face. And if thou wilt
not relent or come to reason for me, do so for the sake of that poor
knight thou hast beside thee; thy master I mean, whose soul I can this
moment see, how he has it stuck in his throat not ten fingers from his
lips, and only waiting for thy inflexible or yielding reply to make
its escape by his mouth or go back again into his stomach." Don
Quixote on hearing this felt his throat, and turning to the duke he
said, "By God, senor, Dulcinea says true, I have my soul stuck here in
my throat like the nut of a crossbow." "What say you to this, Sancho?"
said the duchess. "I say, senora," returned Sancho, "what I said
before; as for the lashes, abernuncio!" "Abrenuncio, you should say,
Sancho, and not as you do," said the duke. "Let me alone, your
highness," said Sancho. "I'm not in a humour now to look into niceties
or a letter more or less, for these lashes that are to be given me, or
I'm to give myself, have so upset me, that I don't know what I'm
saying or doing. But I'd like to know of this lady, my lady Dulcinea
del Toboso, where she learned this way she has of asking favours. She
comes to ask me to score my flesh with lashes, and she calls me soul
of a pitcher, and great untamed brute, and a string of foul names that
the devil is welcome to. Is my flesh brass? or is it anything to me
whether she is enchanted or not? Does she bring with her a basket of
fair linen, shirts, kerchiefs, socks-not that wear any--to coax me?
No, nothing but one piece of abuse after another, though she knows the
proverb they have here that 'an ass loaded with gold goes lightly up a
mountain,' and that 'gifts break rocks,' and 'praying to God and
plying the hammer,' and that 'one "take" is better than two "I'll give
thee's."' Then there's my master, who ought to stroke me down and pet
me to make me turn wool and carded cotton; he says if he gets hold of
me he'll tie me naked to a tree and double the tale of lashes on me.
These tender-hearted gentry should consider that it's not merely a
squire, but a governor they are asking to whip himself; just as if it
was 'drink with cherries.' Let them learn, plague take them, the right
way to ask, and beg, and behave themselves; for all times are not
alike, nor are people always in good humour. I'm now ready to burst
with grief at seeing my green coat torn, and they come to ask me to
whip myself of my own free will, I having as little fancy for it as
for turning cacique." "Well then, the fact is, friend Sancho," said
the duke, "that unless you become softer than a ripe fig, you shall
not get hold of the government. It would be a nice thing for me to
send my islanders a cruel governor with flinty bowels, who won't yield
to the tears of afflicted damsels or to the prayers of wise,
magisterial, ancient enchanters and sages. In short, Sancho, either
you must be whipped by yourself, or they must whip you, or you shan't
be governor." "Senor," said Sancho, "won't two days' grace be given me
in which to consider what is best for me?" "No, certainly not," said
Merlin; "here, this minute, and on the spot, the matter must be
settled; either Dulcinea will return to the cave of Montesinos and to
her former condition of peasant wench, or else in her present form
shall be carried to the Elysian fields, where she will remain waiting
until the number of stripes is completed." "Now then, Sancho!" said
the duchess, "show courage, and gratitude for your master Don
Quixote's bread that you have eaten; we are all bound to oblige and
please him for his benevolent disposition and lofty chivalry. Consent
to this whipping, my son; to the devil with the devil, and leave fear
to milksops, for 'a stout heart breaks bad luck,' as you very well
know." To this Sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which,
addressing Merlin, he made to him, "Will your worship tell me, Senor
Merlin--when that courier devil came up he gave my master a message
from Senor Montesinos, charging him to wait for him here, as he was
coming to arrange how the lady Dona Dulcinea del Toboso was to be
disenchanted; but up to the present we have not seen Montesinos, nor
anything like him." To which Merlin made answer, "The devil, Sancho,
is a blockhead and a great scoundrel; I sent him to look for your
master, but not with a message from Montesinos but from myself; for
Montesinos is in his cave expecting, or more properly speaking,
waiting for his disenchantment; for there's the tail to be skinned yet
for him; if he owes you anything, or you have any business to transact
with him, I'll bring him to you and put him where you choose; but for
the present make up your mind to consent to this penance, and believe
me it will be very good for you, for soul as well for body--for your
soul because of the charity with which you perform it, for your body
because I know that you are of a sanguine habit and it will do you no
harm to draw a little blood." "There are a great many doctors in the
world; even the enchanters are doctors," said Sancho; "however, as
everybody tells me the same thing--though I can't see it myself--I say
I am willing to give myself the three thousand three hundred lashes,
provided I am to lay them on whenever I like, without any fixing of
days or times; and I'll try and get out of debt as quickly as I can,
that the world may enjoy the beauty of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso;
as it seems, contrary to what I thought, that she is beautiful after
all. It must be a condition, too, that I am not to be bound to draw
blood with the scourge, and that if any of the lashes happen to be
fly-flappers they are to count. Item, that, in case I should make any
mistake in the reckoning, Senor Merlin, as he knows everything, is to
keep count, and let me know how many are still wanting or over the
number." "There will be no need to let you know of any over," said
Merlin, "because, when you reach the full number, the lady Dulcinea
will at once, and that very instant, be disenchanted, and will come in
her gratitude to seek out the worthy Sancho, and thank him, and even
reward him for the good work. So you have no cause to be uneasy about
stripes too many or too few; heaven forbid I should cheat anyone of
even a hair of his head." "Well then, in God's hands be it," said
Sancho; "in the hard case I'm in I give in; I say I accept the penance
on the conditions laid down." The instant Sancho uttered these last
words the music of the clarions struck up once more, and again a host
of muskets were discharged, and Don Quixote hung on Sancho's neck
kissing him again and again on the forehead and cheeks. The duchess
and the duke expressed the greatest satisfaction, the car began to
move on, and as it passed the fair Dulcinea bowed to the duke and
duchess and made a low curtsey to Sancho. And now bright smiling dawn
came on apace; the flowers of the field, revived, raised up their
heads, and the crystal waters of the brooks, murmuring over the grey
and white pebbles, hastened to pay their tribute to the expectant
rivers; the glad earth, the unclouded sky, the fresh breeze, the clear
light, each and all showed that the day that came treading on the
skirts of morning would be calm and bright. The duke and duchess,
pleased with their hunt and at having carried out their plans so
cleverly and successfully, returned to their castle resolved to follow
up their joke; for to them there was no reality that could afford them
more amusement. CHAPTER XXXVI. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE AND
UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED DUENNA, ALIAS THE COUNTESS
TRIFALDI, TOGETHER WITH A LETTER WHICH SANCHO PANZA WROTE TO HIS WIFE,
TERESA PANZA The duke had a majordomo of a very facetious and sportive
turn, and he it was that played the part of Merlin, made all the
arrangements for the late adventure, composed the verses, and got a
page to represent Dulcinea; and now, with the assistance of his master
and mistress, he got up another of the drollest and strangest
contrivances that can be imagined. The duchess asked Sancho the next
day if he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. But scarcely
did he find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought
struck him, one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at
the very outset. It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a
knight, and that according to the law of chivalry he neither could nor
ought to bear arms against any knight; and that even if he had been,
still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear white armour, without a
device upon the shield until by his prowess he had earned one. These
reflections made him waver in his purpose, but his craze being
stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to have himself
dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the example
of others in the same case, as he had read in the books that brought
him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on the first
opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and so
comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horse
chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures. Thus
setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to
himself and saying, "Who knows but that in time to come, when the
veracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who
writes it, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early
morning, will do it after this fashion? 'Scarce had the rubicund
Apollo spread o'er the face of the broad spacious earth the golden
threads of his bright hair, scarce had the little birds of painted
plumage attuned their notes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous
harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of
her jealous spouse, was appearing to mortals at the gates and
balconies of the east, shaking from her locks a profusion of liquid
pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, the plants, too, seemed to
shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows distilled sweet
manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the woods rejoiced,
and the meadows arrayed themselves in all their glory at her coming.
But hardly had the light of day made it possible to see and
distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to the
eyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove's nose, which was so
big that it almost overshadowed his whole body. It is, in fact,
stated, that it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered
with warts, and of a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down
two fingers' length below his mouth, and the size, the colour, the
warts, and the bend of it, made his face so hideous, that Sancho, as
he looked at him, began to tremble hand and foot like a child in
convulsions, and he vowed in his heart to let himself be given two
hundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fight that monster. Don
Quixote examined his adversary, and found that he already had his
helmet on and visor lowered, so that he could not see his face; he
observed, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very tall
in stature. Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what
seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering
mirrors like little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and
splendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of
plumes, green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning
against a tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more
than a palm in length. Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all,
and from what he saw and observed he concluded that the said knight
must be a man of great strength, but he did not for all that give way
to fear, like Sancho Panza; on the contrary, with a composed and
dauntless air, he said to the Knight of the Mirrors, "If, sir knight,
your great eagerness to fight has not banished your courtesy, by it I
would entreat you to raise your visor a little, in order that I may
see if the comeliness of your countenance corresponds with that of
your equipment." "Whether you come victorious or vanquished out of
this emprise, sir knight," replied he of the Mirrors, "you will have
more than enough time and leisure to see me; and if now I do not
comply with your request, it is because it seems to me I should do a
serious wrong to the fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I
stopped to raise my visor before compelling you to confess what you
are already aware I maintain." "Well then," said Don Quixote, "while
we are mounting you can at least tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom
you said you vanquished." "To that we answer you," said he of the
Mirrors, "that you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg
is like another, but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not
venture to say positively whether you are the said person or not."
"That," said Don Quixote, "is enough to convince me that you are under
a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be
brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor,
if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your
face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you
take me to be." With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted,
and Don Quixote wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper
distance to charge back upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did
the same; but Don Quixote had not moved away twenty paces when he
heard himself called by the other, and, each returning half-way, he of
the Mirrors said to him, "Remember, sir knight, that the terms of our
combat are, that the vanquished, as I said before, shall be at the
victor's disposal." "I am aware of it already," said Don Quixote;
"provided what is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things
that do not transgress the limits of chivalry." "That is understood,"
replied he of the Mirrors. At this moment the extraordinary nose of
the squire presented itself to Don Quixote's view, and he was no less
amazed than Sancho at the sight; insomuch that he set him down as a
monster of some kind, or a human being of some new species or
unearthly breed. Sancho, seeing his master retiring to run his course,
did not like to be left alone with the nosy man, fearing that with one
flap of that nose on his own the battle would be all over for him and
he would be left stretched on the ground, either by the blow or with
fright; so he ran after his master, holding on to Rocinante's
stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time to turn about, he
said, "I implore of your worship, senor, before you turn to charge, to
help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be able to witness
the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with this knight,
more to my taste and better than from the ground." "It seems to me
rather, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "that thou wouldst mount a scaffold
in order to see the bulls without danger." "To tell the truth,"
returned Sancho, "the monstrous nose of that squire has filled me with
fear and terror, and I dare not stay near him." "It is," said Don
Quixote, "such a one that were I not what I am it would terrify me
too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou wilt." While Don Quixote
waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he of the Mirrors took
as much ground as he considered requisite, and, supposing Don Quixote
to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of trumpet or
other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse, which was not more
agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his top speed, which
was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy; seeing him,
however, engaged in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and halted in mid
career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was already
unable to go. Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was coming down upon
him flying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante's lean flanks
and made him scud along in such style that the history tells us that
on this occasion only was he known to make something like running, for
on all others it was a simple trot with him; and with this
unparalleled fury he bore down where he of the Mirrors stood digging
his spurs into his horse up to buttons, without being able to make him
stir a finger's length from the spot where he had come to a standstill
in his course. At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote came upon
his adversary, in trouble with his horse, and embarrassed with his
lance, which he either could not manage, or had no time to lay in
rest. Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these difficulties,
and in perfect safety to himself and without any risk encountered him
of the Mirrors with such force that he brought him to the ground in
spite of himself over the haunches of his horse, and with so heavy a
fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or foot.
The instant Sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, and
made all haste to where his master was, who, dismounting from
Rocinante, went and stood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his
helmet to see if he was dead, and to give him air if he should happen
to be alive, he saw--who can say what he saw, without filling all who
hear it with astonishment, wonder, and awe? He saw, the history says,
the very countenance, the very face, the very look, the very
physiognomy, the very effigy, the very image of the bachelor Samson
Carrasco! As soon as he saw it he called out in a loud voice, "Make
haste here, Sancho, and behold what thou art to see but not to
believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic can do, and wizards and
enchanters are capable of." Sancho came up, and when he saw the
countenance of the bachelor Carrasco, he fell to crossing himself a
thousand times, and blessing himself as many more. All this time the
prostrate knight showed no signs of life, and Sancho said to Don
Quixote, "It is my opinion, senor, that in any case your worship
should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of this one here that
looks like the bachelor Samson Carrasco; perhaps in him you will kill
one of your enemies, the enchanters." "Thy advice is not bad," said
Don Quixote, "for of enemies the fewer the better;" and he was drawing
his sword to carry into effect Sancho's counsel and suggestion, when
the squire of the Mirrors came up, now without the nose which had made
him so hideous, and cried out in a loud voice, "Mind what you are
about, Senor Don Quixote; that is your friend, the bachelor Samson
Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I am his squire." "And the nose?"
said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature he had before; to
which he replied, "I have it here in my pocket," and putting his hand
into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose of varnished
pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho, examining him
more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of amazement, "Holy
Mary be good to me! Isn't it Tom Cecial, my neighbour and gossip?"
"Why, to be sure I am!" returned the now unnosed squire; "Tom Cecial I
am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I'll tell you presently the
means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but
in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch,
maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his
feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised
bachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman." At this moment he of
the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote perceiving it, held the
naked point of his sword over his face, and said to him, "You are a
dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless Dulcinea del
Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty; and in addition to
this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter and fall,
to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself before her on my
behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and if
she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and
seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a
guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may have passed
between you and her-conditions which, in accordance with what we
stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of
knight-errantry." "I confess," said the fallen knight, "that the dirty
tattered shoe of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the
ill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to
return from her presence to yours, and to give you a full and
particular account of all you demand of me." "You must also confess
and believe," added Don Quixote, "that the knight you vanquished was
not and could not be Don Quixote of La Mancha, but some one else in
his likeness, just as I confess and believe that you, though you seem
to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not so, but some other
resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before me in his shape,
in order that I may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my wrath,
and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory." "I confess, hold,
and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and think it," the
crippled knight; "let me rise, I entreat you; if, indeed, the shock of
my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight enough."
Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom
Cecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put
questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was
really and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on
Sancho's mind by what his master said about the enchanters having
changed the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the
bachelor Samson Carrasco, would not permit him to believe what he saw
with his eyes. In fine, both master and man remained under the
delusion; and, down in the mouth, and out of luck, he of the Mirrors
and his squire parted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he meaning to go
look for some village where he could plaster and strap his ribs. Don
Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the
history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knight of the
Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were. CHAPTER XV. WHEREIN IT IS TOLD
AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS SQUIRE WERE Don
Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest
degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he
fancied him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he
expected to learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued;
inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of
ceasing to be one, to return and render him an account of what took
place between him and her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the
Mirrors of another, for he just then had no thought of anything but
finding some village where he could plaster himself, as has been said
already. The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor
Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his knight-errantry
which he had laid aside, it was in consequence of having been
previously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to
be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet
without worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures; at which
consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on the
special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go,
as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sally
forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for
there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that
being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and
settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor.
Then, Don Quixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command
him to return to his village and his house, and not quit it for two
years, or until he received further orders from him; all which it was
clear Don Quixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or
fail to observe the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his
seclusion he might perhaps forget his folly, or there might be an
opportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his madness. Carrasco
undertook the task, and Tom Cecial, a gossip and neighbour of Sancho
Panza's, a lively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his
squire. Carrasco armed himself in the fashion described, and Tom
Cecial, that he might not be known by his gossip when they met, fitted
on over his own natural nose the false masquerade one that has been
mentioned; and so they followed the same route Don Quixote took, and
almost came up with him in time to be present at the adventure of the
cart of Death and finally encountered them in the grove, where all
that the sagacious reader has been reading about took place; and had
it not been for the millers, who plunged in and hoisted them both out,
it would have been Troy town with the pair of them. As soon as, more
drenched than thirsty, they were landed, Sancho went down on his knees
and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven, prayed a long and
fervent prayer to God to deliver him evermore from the rash projects
and attempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of the boat,
which the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeing
it smashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for it
from Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing had
happened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for the
bark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him, free
and unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castle
of theirs. "What persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman?
Art thou for carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these
mills?" "That's enough," said Don Quixote to himself, "it would be
preaching in the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble
to do any virtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters
must have encountered one another, and one frustrates what the other
attempts; one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God
help us, this world is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes
one with the other. I can do no more." And then turning towards the
mills he said aloud, "Friends, whoe'er ye be that are immured in that
prison, forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver
you from your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and
destined for some other knight." So saying he settled with the
fishermen, and paid fifty reals for the boat, which Sancho handed to
them very much against the grain, saying, "With a couple more bark
businesses like this we shall have sunk our whole capital." The
fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two
figures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and
were wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and
questions Don Quixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion
that they were madmen, they left them and betook themselves, the
millers to their mills, and the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixote
and Sancho returned to their beasts, and to their life of beasts, and
so ended the adventure of the enchanted bark. CHAPTER XXX. OF DON
QUIXOTE'S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR HUNTRESS CHAPTER XXXI WHICH TREATS OF
MANY AND GREAT MATTERS CHAPTER XXXII OF THE REPLY DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS
CENSURER, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS, GRAVE AND DROLL Don Quixote, then,
having risen to his feet, trembling from head to foot like a man dosed
with mercury, said in a hurried, agitated voice, "The place I am in,
the presence in which I stand, and the respect I have and always have
had for the profession to which your worship belongs, hold and bind
the hands of my just indignation; and as well for these reasons as
because I know, as everyone knows, that a gownsman's weapon is the
same as a woman's, the tongue, I will with mine engage in equal combat
with your worship, from whom one might have expected good advice
instead of foul abuse. Pious, well-meant reproof requires a different
demeanour and arguments of another sort; at any rate, to have reproved
me in public, and so roughly, exceeds the bounds of proper reproof,
for that comes better with gentleness than with rudeness; and it is
not seemly to call the sinner roundly blockhead and booby, without
knowing anything of the sin that is reproved. Come, tell me, for which
of the stupidities you have observed in me do you condemn and abuse
me, and bid me go home and look after my house and wife and children,
without knowing whether I have any? Is nothing more needed than to get
a footing, by hook or by crook, in other people's houses to rule over
the masters (and that, perhaps, after having been brought up in all
the straitness of some seminary, and without having ever seen more of
the world than may lie within twenty or thirty leagues round), to fit
one to lay down the law rashly for chivalry, and pass judgment on
knights-errant? Is it, haply, an idle occupation, or is the time
ill-spent that is spent in roaming the world in quest, not of its
enjoyments, but of those arduous toils whereby the good mount upwards
to the abodes of everlasting life? If gentlemen, great lords, nobles,
men of high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take it as an
irreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have never
entered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish.
Knight I am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the
Most High. Some take the broad road of overweening ambition; others
that of mean and servile flattery; others that of deceitful hypocrisy,
and some that of true religion; but I, led by my star, follow the
narrow path of knight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I
despise wealth, but not honour. I have redressed injuries, righted
wrongs, punished insolences, vanquished giants, and crushed monsters;
I am in love, for no other reason than that it is incumbent on
knights-errant to be so; but though I am, I am no carnal-minded lover,
but one of the chaste, platonic sort. My intentions are always
directed to worthy ends, to do good to all and evil to none; and if he
who means this, does this, and makes this his practice deserves to be
called a fool, it is for your highnesses to say, O most excellent duke
and duchess." "Good, by God!" cried Sancho; "say no more in your own
defence, master mine, for there's nothing more in the world to be
said, thought, or insisted on; and besides, when this gentleman
denies, as he has, that there are or ever have been any knights-errant
in the world, is it any wonder if he knows nothing of what he has been
talking about?" "Perhaps, brother," said the ecclesiastic, "you are
that Sancho Panza that is mentioned, to whom your master has promised
an island?" "Yes, I am," said Sancho, "and what's more, I am one who
deserves it as much as anyone; I am one of the sort--'Attach thyself
to the good, and thou wilt be one of them,' and of those, 'Not with
whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed.' Well then, if he be
mad, as he is, and with a madness that mostly takes one thing for
another, and white for black, and black for white, as was seen when he
said the windmills were giants, and the monks' mules dromedaries,
flocks of sheep armies of enemies, and much more to the same tune, it
will not be very hard to make him believe that some country girl, the
first I come across here, is the lady Dulcinea; and if he does not
believe it, I'll swear it; and if he should swear, I'll swear again;
and if he persists I'll persist still more, so as, come what may, to
have my quoit always over the peg. Maybe, by holding out in this way,
I may put a stop to his sending me on messages of this kind another
time; or maybe he will think, as I suspect he will, that one of those
wicked enchanters, who he says have a spite against him, has changed
her form for the sake of doing him an ill turn and injuring him." With
this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the business as
good as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make Don
Quixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and
things turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount
Dapple, he spied, coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he
stood, three peasant girls on three colts, or fillies--for the author
does not make the point clear, though it is more likely they were
she-asses, the usual mount with village girls; but as it is of no
great consequence, we need not stop to prove it. To be brief, the
instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned full speed to seek
his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousand passionate
lamentations. When Don Quixote saw him he exclaimed, "What news,
Sancho, my friend? Am I to mark this day with a white stone or a
black?" "Your worship," replied Sancho, "had better mark it with
ruddle, like the inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those
who see it may see it plain." "Then thou bringest good news," said Don
Quixote. "So good," replied Sancho, "that your worship has only to
spur Rocinante and get out into the open field to see the lady
Dulcinea del Toboso, who, with two others, damsels of hers, is coming
to see your worship." "Holy God! what art thou saying, Sancho, my
friend?" exclaimed Don Quixote. "Take care thou art not deceiving me,
or seeking by false joy to cheer my real sadness." "What could I get
by deceiving your worship," returned Sancho, "especially when it will
so soon be shown whether I tell the truth or not? Come, senor, push
on, and you will see the princess our mistress coming, robed and
adorned--in fact, like what she is. Her damsels and she are all one
glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, all rubies, all
cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hair loose on
their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind; and
moreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest
sight ever you saw." "Hackneys, you mean, Sancho," said Don Quixote.
"There is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys," said
Sancho; "but no matter what they come on, there they are, the finest
ladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princess Dulcinea,
who staggers one's senses." "Let us go, Sancho, my son," said Don
Quixote, "and in guerdon of this news, as unexpected as it is good, I
bestow upon thee the best spoil I shall win in the first adventure I
may have; or if that does not satisfy thee, I promise thee the foals I
shall have this year from my three mares that thou knowest are in foal
on our village common." "I'll take the foals," said Sancho; "for it is
not quite certain that the spoils of the first adventure will be good
ones." By this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three
village lasses close at hand. Don Quixote looked all along the road to
El Toboso, and as he could see nobody except the three peasant girls,
he was completely puzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city
he had left them. "How outside the city?" returned Sancho. "Are your
worship's eyes in the back of your head, that you can't see that they
are these who are coming here, shining like the very sun at noonday?"
"I see nothing, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "but three country girls on
three jackasses." "Now, may God deliver me from the devil!" said
Sancho, "and can it be that your worship takes three hackneys--or
whatever they're called-as white as the driven snow, for jackasses? By
the Lord, I could tear my beard if that was the case!" "Well, I can
only say, Sancho, my friend," said Don Quixote, "that it is as plain
they are jackasses--or jennyasses--as that I am Don Quixote, and thou
Sancho Panza: at any rate, they seem to me to be so." "Hush, senor,"
said Sancho, "don't talk that way, but open your eyes, and come and
pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts, who is close upon us
now;" and with these words he advanced to receive the three village
lasses, and dismounting from Dapple, caught hold of one of the asses
of the three country girls by the halter, and dropping on both knees
on the ground, he said, "Queen and princess and duchess of beauty, may
it please your haughtiness and greatness to receive into your favour
and good-will your captive knight who stands there turned into marble
stone, and quite stupefied and benumbed at finding himself in your
magnificent presence. I am Sancho Panza, his squire, and he the
vagabond knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called 'The Knight
of the Rueful Countenance.'" Don Quixote had by this time placed
himself on his knees beside Sancho, and, with eyes starting out of his
head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding her whom Sancho called queen
and lady; and as he could see nothing in her except a village lass,
and not a very well-favoured one, for she was platter-faced and
snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did not venture to
open his lips. The country girls, at the same time, were astonished to
see these two men, so different in appearance, on their knees,
preventing their companion from going on. She, however, who had been
stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and testily, "Get out of the
way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we are in a hurry." To
which Sancho returned, "Oh, princess and universal lady of El Toboso,
is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and prop
of knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?" On
hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, "Woa then! why, I'm rubbing
thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlings come to
make game of the village girls now, as if we here could not chaff as
well as themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will
be better for you." "Get up, Sancho," said Don Quixote at this; "I see
that fortune, 'with evil done to me unsated still,' has taken
possession of all the roads by which any comfort may reach 'this
wretched soul' that I carry in my flesh. And thou, highest perfection
of excellence that can be desired, utmost limit of grace in human
shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart that adores thee, though
the malign enchanter that persecutes me has brought clouds and
cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them only, transformed thy
unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into those of a poor
peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same time changed mine into
those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy sight, refuse
not to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing in this
submission that I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the
humility with which my soul adores thee." "Hey-day! My grandfather!"
cried the girl, "much I care for your love-making! Get out of the way
and let us pass, and we'll thank you." Sancho stood aside and let her
go, very well pleased to have got so well out of the hobble he was in.
The instant the village lass who had done duty for Dulcinea found
herself free, prodding her "cackney" with a spike she had at the end
of a stick, she set off at full speed across the field. The she-ass,
however, feeling the point more acutely than usual, began cutting such
capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to the ground; seeing which,
Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho to fix and girth the
pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass's belly. The
pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to lift up his
enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast, the lady,
getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going back a
little, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of
the ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and
sat astride like a man, whereat Sancho said, "Rogue! but our lady is
lighter than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest Cordovan or
Mexican how to mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump,
and without spurs she is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her
damsels are no way behind her, for they all fly like the wind;" which
was the truth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they pushed
on after her, and sped away without looking back, for more than half a
league. Don Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no
longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said, "Come here, my
son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has
commanded me." "My oath on it," said Andres, "your worship will be
well advised to obey the command of that good knight--may he live a
thousand years--for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if
you do not pay me, he will come back and do as he said." "My oath on
it, too," said the farmer; "but as I have a strong affection for you,
I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;" and seizing
him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a flogging
that he left him for dead. "Now, Master Andres," said the farmer,
"call on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he won't undo that,
though I am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have a
good mind to flay you alive." But at last he untied him, and gave him
leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence pronounced
into execution. Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he
would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him
exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him
sevenfold; but for all that, he went off weeping, while his master
stood laughing. Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong,
and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered
he had made a very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he
took the road towards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a
low voice, "Well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all
on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has
fallen to thy lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and
pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La
Mancha, who, as all the world knows, yesterday received the order of
knighthood, and hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance
that ever injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day
plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly
lashing that tender child." He now came to a road branching in four
directions, and immediately he was reminded of those cross-roads where
knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take.
In imitation of them he halted for a while, and after having deeply
considered it, he gave Rocinante his head, submitting his own will to
that of his hack, who followed out his first intention, which was to
make straight for his own stable. After he had gone about two miles
Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who, as afterwards
appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to buy silk at
Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their sunshades,
with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had
Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that this must
be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could
those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one
made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing
and determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his
lance ready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting
himself in the middle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to
this effect: "Ho ye travellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk
on foot or on horseback, who pass this way or shall pass in the course
of the next two days! Know that Don Quixote of La Mancha,
knight-errant, is posted here to maintain by arms that the beauty and
courtesy enshrined in the nymphs that dwell in these meadows and
groves surpass all upon earth, putting aside the lady of my heart,
Dulcinea del Toboso. Wherefore, let him who is of the opposite opinion
come on, for here I await him." Twice he repeated the same words, and
twice they fell unheard by any adventurer; but fate, that was guiding
affairs for him from better to better, so ordered it that shortly
afterwards there appeared on the road a crowd of men on horseback,
many of them with lances in their hands, all riding in a compact body
and in great haste. No sooner had those who were with Don Quixote seen
them than they turned about and withdrew to some distance from the
road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm might come to them;
but Don Quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground, and Sancho Panza
shielded himself with Rocinante's hind-quarters. The troop of lancers
came up, and one of them who was in advance began shouting to Don
Quixote, "Get out of the way, you son of the devil, or these bulls
will knock you to pieces!" "Rabble!" returned Don Quixote, "I care
nothing for bulls, be they the fiercest Jarama breeds on its banks.
Confess at once, scoundrels, that what I have declared is true; else
ye have to deal with me in combat." The herdsman had no time to reply,
nor Don Quixote to get out of the way even if he wished; and so the
drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks, together with the crowd of
herdsmen and others who were taking them to be penned up in a village
where they were to be run the next day, passed over Don Quixote and
over Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple, hurling them all to the earth and
rolling them over on the ground. Sancho was left crushed, Don Quixote
scared, Dapple belaboured and Rocinante in no very sound condition.
They all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste,
stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove,
shouting out, "Hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaits
you, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, 'For a
flying enemy make a bridge of silver.'" The retreating party in their
haste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his menaces any more
than last year's clouds. Weariness brought Don Quixote to a halt, and
more enraged than avenged he sat down on the road to wait until
Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple came up. When they reached him master and
man mounted once more, and without going back to bid farewell to the
mock or imitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation than contentment,
they continued their journey. CHAPTER LIX. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE
STRANGE THING, WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS AN ADVENTURE, THAT HAPPENED
DON QUIXOTE CHAPTER LX OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO
BARCELONA CHAPTER LXI OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON ENTERING
BARCELONA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS THAT PARTAKE OF THE TRUE RATHER
THAN OF THE INGENIOUS Don Quixote passed three days and three nights
with Roque, and had he passed three hundred years he would have found
enough to observe and wonder at in his mode of life. At daybreak they
were in one spot, at dinner-time in another; sometimes they fled
without knowing from whom, at other times they lay in wait, not
knowing for what. They slept standing, breaking their slumbers to
shift from place to place. There was nothing but sending out spies and
scouts, posting sentinels and blowing the matches of harquebusses,
though they carried but few, for almost all used flintlocks. Roque
passed his nights in some place or other apart from his men, that they
might not know where he was, for the many proclamations the viceroy of
Barcelona had issued against his life kept him in fear and uneasiness,
and he did not venture to trust anyone, afraid that even his own men
would kill him or deliver him up to the authorities; of a truth, a
weary miserable life! At length, by unfrequented roads, short cuts,
and secret paths, Roque, Don Quixote, and Sancho, together with six
squires, set out for Barcelona. They reached the strand on Saint
John's Eve during the night; and Roque, after embracing Don Quixote
and Sancho (to whom he presented the ten crowns he had promised but
had not until then given), left them with many expressions of
good-will on both sides. Roque went back, while Don Quixote remained
on horseback, just as he was, waiting for day, and it was not long
before the countenance of the fair Aurora began to show itself at the
balconies of the east, gladdening the grass and flowers, if not the
ear, though to gladden that too there came at the same moment a sound
of clarions and drums, and a din of bells, and a tramp, tramp, and
cries of "Clear the way there!" of some runners, that seemed to issue
from the city. The dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader
than a buckler began to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon;
Don Quixote and Sancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a
sight until then unseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly
spacious and broad, much more so than the lakes of Ruidera which they
had seen in La Mancha. They saw the galleys along the beach, which,
lowering their awnings, displayed themselves decked with streamers and
pennons that trembled in the breeze and kissed and swept the water,
while on board the bugles, trumpets, and clarions were sounding and
filling the air far and near with melodious warlike notes. Then they
began to move and execute a kind of skirmish upon the calm water,
while a vast number of horsemen on fine horses and in showy liveries,
issuing from the city, engaged on their side in a somewhat similar
movement. The soldiers on board the galleys kept up a ceaseless fire,
which they on the walls and forts of the city returned, and the heavy
cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise they made, to which the
gangway guns of the galleys replied. The bright sea, the smiling
earth, the clear air--though at times darkened by the smoke of the
guns--all seemed to fill the whole multitude with unexpected delight.
Sancho could not make out how it was that those great masses that
moved over the sea had so many feet. And now the horsemen in livery
came galloping up with shouts and outlandish cries and cheers to where
Don Quixote stood amazed and wondering; and one of them, he to whom
Roque had sent word, addressing him exclaimed, "Welcome to our city,
mirror, beacon, star and cynosure of all knight-errantry in its widest
extent! Welcome, I say, valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; not the
false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, that these latter days have
offered us in lying histories, but the true, the legitimate, the real
one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower of historians, has described to
us!" Don Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one,
but wheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting
round Don Quixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, "These gentlemen have
plainly recognised us; I will wager they have read our history, and
even that newly printed one by the Aragonese." The cavalier who had
addressed Don Quixote again approached him and said, "Come with us,
Senor Don Quixote, for we are all of us your servants and great
friends of Roque Guinart's;" to which Don Quixote returned, "If
courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughter or very
nearly akin to the great Roque's; carry me where you please; I will
have no will but yours, especially if you deign to employ it in your
service." The cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then,
all closing in around him, they set out with him for the city, to the
music of the clarions and the drums. As they were entering it, the
wicked one, who is the author of all mischief, and the boys who are
wickeder than the wicked one, contrived that a couple of these
audacious irrepressible urchins should force their way through the
crowd, and lifting up, one of them Dapple's tail and the other
Rocinante's, insert a bunch of furze under each. The poor beasts felt
the strange spurs and added to their anguish by pressing their tails
tight, so much so that, cutting a multitude of capers, they flung
their masters to the ground. Don Quixote, covered with shame and out
of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from his poor jade's tail,
while Sancho did the same for Dapple. His conductors tried to punish
the audacity of the boys, but there was no possibility of doing so,
for they hid themselves among the hundreds of others that were
following them. Don Quixote and Sancho mounted once more, and with the
same music and acclamations reached their conductor's house, which was
large and stately, that of a rich gentleman, in short; and there for
the present we will leave them, for such is Cide Hamete's pleasure.
CHAPTER LXII. WHICH DEALS WITH THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED HEAD,
TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRIVIAL MATTERS WHICH CANNOT BE LEFT UNTOLD Don
Quixote's host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentleman of
wealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any
fair and good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his house he set
about devising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some
harmless fashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport
is worth anything if it hurts another. The first thing he did was to
clean up some armour that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and
had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and
covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as best he could, but
he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet,
nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his ingenuity
supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard which,
fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that, in
order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his
sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an
instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had
knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against
that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside
until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try
any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet
of the most perfect construction. He next proceeded to inspect his
hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the
steed of Gonela, that "tantum pellis et ossa fuit," surpassed in his
eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid. Four days
were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to
himself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so
famous, and one with such merits of his own, should be without some
distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he
had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and what he then was;
for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new character, he
should take a new name, and that it should be a distinguished and
full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he was about to
follow. And so, after having composed, struck out, rejected, added to,
unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his memory and fancy,
he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his thinking, lofty,
sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack before he became
what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world.
Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious
to get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this
point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself "Don Quixote,"
whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious
history have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt
Quixada, and not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting,
however, that the valiant Amadis was not content to call himself
curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and
country to make it famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like
a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his, and to style
himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described
accurately his origin and country, and did honour to it in taking his
surname from it. So then, his armour being furbished, his morion
turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and he himself confirmed,
he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look
out for a lady to be in love with; for a knight-errant without love
was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As
he said to himself, "If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come
across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant,
and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the
waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to
have some one I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and
fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive
voice say, 'I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of
Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently
extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to
present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at
your pleasure'?" Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of
this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his
Lady! There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very
good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love,
though, so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to
the matter. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit
to confer the title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for
a name which should not be out of harmony with her own, and should
suggest and indicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided
upon calling her Dulcinea del Toboso--she being of El Toboso--a name,
to his mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had
already bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him. CHAPTER
II. WHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE
FROM HOME These preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any
longer the execution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of
all the world was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended
to right, grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to
remove, and duties to discharge. So, without giving notice of his
intention to anyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning
before the dawning of the day (which was one of the hottest of the
month of July) he donned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with
his patched-up helmet on, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by
the back door of the yard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest
contentment and satisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a
beginning with his penance task which he had to perform for the
disenchantment of Dulcinea. He said he had, and had given himself five
lashes overnight. The duchess asked him what he had given them with.
He said with his hand. "That," said the duchess, "is more like giving
oneself slaps than lashes; I am sure the sage Merlin will not be
satisfied with such tenderness; worthy Sancho must make a scourge with
claws, or a cat-o'-nine tails, that will make itself felt; for it's
with blood that letters enter, and the release of so great a lady as
Dulcinea will not be granted so cheaply, or at such a paltry price;
and remember, Sancho, that works of charity done in a lukewarm and
half-hearted way are without merit and of no avail." To which Sancho
replied, "If your ladyship will give me a proper scourge or cord, I'll
lay on with it, provided it does not hurt too much; for you must know,
boor as I am, my flesh is more cotton than hemp, and it won't do for
me to destroy myself for the good of anybody else." "So be it by all
means," said Sancho; "and I will tell your worship who I am, that you
may see whether I am to be reckoned among the number of the most
talkative squires." With this the two squires withdrew to one side,
and between them there passed a conversation as droll as that which
passed between their masters was serious. CHAPTER XIII. IN WHICH IS
CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE Among the things
that passed between Don Quixote and the Knight of the Wood, the
history tells us he of the Grove said to Don Quixote, "In fine, sir
knight, I would have you know that my destiny, or, more properly
speaking, my choice led me to fall in love with the peerless Casildea
de Vandalia. I call her peerless because she has no peer, whether it
be in bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty. This same
Casildea, then, that I speak of, requited my honourable passion and
gentle aspirations by compelling me, as his stepmother did Hercules,
to engage in many perils of various sorts, at the end of each
promising me that, with the end of the next, the object of my hopes
should be attained; but my labours have gone on increasing link by
link until they are past counting, nor do I know what will be the last
one that is to be the beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste
desires. On one occasion she bade me go and challenge the famous
giantess of Seville, La Giralda by name, who is as mighty and strong
as if made of brass, and though never stirring from one spot, is the
most restless and changeable woman in the world. I came, I saw, I
conquered, and I made her stay quiet and behave herself, for nothing
but north winds blew for more than a week. Another time I was ordered
to lift those ancient stones, the mighty bulls of Guisando, an
enterprise that might more fitly be entrusted to porters than to
knights. Again, she bade me fling myself into the cavern of Cabra--an
unparalleled and awful peril--and bring her a minute account of all
that is concealed in those gloomy depths. I stopped the motion of the
Giralda, I lifted the bulls of Guisando, I flung myself into the
cavern and brought to light the secrets of its abyss; and my hopes are
as dead as dead can be, and her scorn and her commands as lively as
ever. To be brief, last of all she has commanded me to go through all
the provinces of Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering
therein to confess that she surpasses all women alive to-day in
beauty, and that I am the most valiant and the most deeply enamoured
knight on earth; in support of which claim I have already travelled
over the greater part of Spain, and have there vanquished several
knights who have dared to contradict me; but what I most plume and
pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat that so famous
knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess that my Casildea
is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one victory I hold
myself to have conquered all the knights in the world; for this Don
Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having
vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed and
are transferred to my person; for The more the vanquished hath of fair
renown, The greater glory gilds the victor's crown. Thus the
innumerable achievements of the said Don Quixote are now set down to
my account and have become mine." Don Quixote was amazed when he heard
the Knight of the Grove, and was a thousand times on the point of
telling him he lied, and had the lie direct already on the tip of his
tongue; but he restrained himself as well as he could, in order to
force him to confess the lie with his own lips; so he said to him
quietly, "As to what you say, sir knight, about having vanquished most
of the knights of Spain, or even of the whole world, I say nothing;
but that you have vanquished Don Quixote of La Mancha I consider
doubtful; it may have been some other that resembled him, although
there are few like him." "How! not vanquished?" said he of the Grove;
"by the heaven that is above us I fought Don Quixote and overcame him
and made him yield; and he is a man of tall stature, gaunt features,
long, lank limbs, with hair turning grey, an aquiline nose rather
hooked, and large black drooping moustaches; he does battle under the
name of 'The Countenance,' and he has for squire a peasant called
Sancho Panza; he presses the loins and rules the reins of a famous
steed called Rocinante; and lastly, he has for the mistress of his
will a certain Dulcinea del Toboso, once upon a time called Aldonza
Lorenzo, just as I call mine Casildea de Vandalia because her name is
Casilda and she is of Andalusia. If all these tokens are not enough to
vindicate the truth of what I say, here is Don Quixote himself, who
will maintain it by arms, on foot or on horseback or in any way you
please." And so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword,
waiting to see what the Knight of the Grove would do, who in an
equally calm voice said in reply, "Pledges don't distress a good
payer; he who has succeeded in vanquishing you once when transformed,
Sir Don Quixote, may fairly hope to subdue you in your own proper
shape; but as it is not becoming for knights to perform their feats of
arms in the dark, like highwaymen and bullies, let us wait till
daylight, that the sun may behold our deeds; and the conditions of our
combat shall be that the vanquished shall be at the victor's disposal,
to do all that he may enjoin, provided the injunction be such as shall
be becoming a knight." "I am more than satisfied with these conditions
and terms," replied Don Quixote; and so saying, they betook themselves
to where their squires lay, and found them snoring, and in the same
posture they were in when sleep fell upon them. They roused them up,
and bade them get the horses ready, as at sunrise they were to engage
in a bloody and arduous single combat; at which intelligence Sancho
was aghast and thunderstruck, trembling for the safety of his master
because of the mighty deeds he had heard the squire of the Grove
ascribe to his; but without a word the two squires went in quest of
their cattle; for by this time the three horses and the ass had smelt
one another out, and were all together. On the way, he of the Grove
said to Sancho, "You must know, brother, that it is the custom with
the fighting men of Andalusia, when they are godfathers in any
quarrel, not to stand idle with folded arms while their godsons fight;
I say so to remind you that while our masters are fighting, we, too,
have to fight, and knock one another to shivers." "That custom, sir
squire," replied Sancho, "may hold good among those bullies and
fighting men you talk of, but certainly not among the squires of
knights-errant; at least, I have never heard my master speak of any
custom of the sort, and he knows all the laws of knight-errantry by
heart; but granting it true that there is an express law that squires
are to fight while their masters are fighting, I don't mean to obey
it, but to pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefully minded
squires like myself; for I am sure it cannot be more than two pounds
of wax, and I would rather pay that, for I know it will cost me less
than the lint I shall be at the expense of to mend my head, which I
look upon as broken and split already; there's another thing that
makes it impossible for me to fight, that I have no sword, for I never
carried one in my life." "I know a good remedy for that," said he of
the Grove; "I have here two linen bags of the same size; you shall
take one, and I the other, and we will fight at bag blows with equal
arms." "If that's the way, so be it with all my heart," said Sancho,
"for that sort of battle will serve to knock the dust out of us
instead of hurting us." "That will not do," said the other, "for we
must put into the bags, to keep the wind from blowing them away, half
a dozen nice smooth pebbles, all of the same weight; and in this way
we shall be able to baste one another without doing ourselves any harm
or mischief." "Body of my father!" said Sancho, "see what marten and
sable, and pads of carded cotton he is putting into the bags, that our
heads may not be broken and our bones beaten to jelly! But even if
they are filled with toss silk, I can tell you, senor, I am not going
to fight; let our masters fight, that's their lookout, and let us
drink and live; for time will take care to ease us of our lives,
without our going to look for fillips so that they may be finished off
before their proper time comes and they drop from ripeness." "Still,"
returned he of the Grove, "we must fight, if it be only for half an
hour." "By no means," said Sancho; "I am not going to be so
discourteous or so ungrateful as to have any quarrel, be it ever so
small, with one I have eaten and drunk with; besides, who the devil
could bring himself to fight in cold blood, without anger or
provocation?" "I can remedy that entirely," said he of the Grove, "and
in this way: before we begin the battle, I will come up to your
worship fair and softly, and give you three or four buffets, with
which I shall stretch you at my feet and rouse your anger, though it
were sleeping sounder than a dormouse." "To match that plan," said
Sancho, "I have another that is not a whit behind it; I will take a
cudgel, and before your worship comes near enough to waken my anger I
will send yours so sound to sleep with whacks, that it won't waken
unless it be in the other world, where it is known that I am not a man
to let my face be handled by anyone; let each look out for the
arrow--though the surer way would be to let everyone's anger sleep,
for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and a man may come for wool and
go back shorn; God gave his blessing to peace and his curse to
quarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed, turns into a
lion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; and so from this
time forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm and mischief that
may come of our quarrel will be put down to your account." "Very
good," said he of the Grove; "God will send the dawn and we shall be
all right." "Sleep thou, Sancho," returned Don Quixote, "for thou wast
born to sleep as I was born to watch; and during the time it now wants
of dawn I will give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for
them in a little madrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my
head last night." "I should think," said Sancho, "that the thoughts
that allow one to make verses cannot be of great consequence; let your
worship string verses as much as you like and I'll sleep as much as I
can;" and forthwith, taking the space of ground he required, he
muffled himself up and fell into a sound sleep, undisturbed by bond,
debt, or trouble of any sort. Don Quixote, propped up against the
trunk of a beech or a cork tree--for Cide Hamete does not specify what
kind of tree it was--sang in this strain to the accompaniment of his
own sighs: When in my mind I muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty, To death
I flee, In hope therein the end of all to find. But drawing near That
welcome haven in my sea of woe, Such joy I know, That life revives,
and still I linger here. Thus life doth slay, And death again to life
restoreth me; Strange destiny, That deals with life and death as with
a play! He accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears,
just like one whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his
separation from Dulcinea. And now daylight came, and the sun smote
Sancho on the eyes with his beams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook
himself and stretched his lazy limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs
had made with his stores he cursed the drove, and more besides. Then
the pair resumed their journey, and as evening closed in they saw
coming towards them some ten men on horseback and four or five on
foot. Don Quixote's heart beat quick and Sancho's quailed with fear,
for the persons approaching them carried lances and bucklers, and were
in very warlike guise. Don Quixote turned to Sancho and said, "If I
could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not tied my hands, I
would count this host that comes against us but cakes and fancy bread;
but perhaps it may prove something different from what we apprehend."
The men on horseback now came up, and raising their lances surrounded
Don Quixote in silence, and pointed them at his back and breast,
menacing him with death. One of those on foot, putting his finger to
his lips as a sign to him to be silent, seized Rocinante's bridle and
drew him out of the road, and the others driving Sancho and Dapple
before them, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the
steps of the one who led Don Quixote. The latter two or three times
attempted to ask where they were taking him to and what they wanted,
but the instant he began to open his lips they threatened to close
them with the points of their lances; and Sancho fared the same way,
for the moment he seemed about to speak one of those on foot punched
him with a goad, and Dapple likewise, as if he too wanted to talk.
Night set in, they quickened their pace, and the fears of the two
prisoners grew greater, especially as they heard themselves assailed
with--"Get on, ye Troglodytes;" "Silence, ye barbarians;" "March, ye
cannibals;" "No murmuring, ye Scythians;" "Don't open your eyes, ye
murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions," and suchlike names with
which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched master and man.
Sancho went along saying to himself, "We, tortolites, barbers,
animals! I don't like those names at all; 'it's in a bad wind our corn
is being winnowed;' 'misfortune comes upon us all at once like sticks
on a dog,' and God grant it may be no worse than them that this
unlucky adventure has in store for us." Don Quixote rode completely
dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits to make out what could be
the meaning of these abusive names they called them, and the only
conclusion he could arrive at was that there was no good to be hoped
for and much evil to be feared. And now, about an hour after midnight,
they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at once was the duke's,
where they had been but a short time before. "God bless me!" said he,
as he recognised the mansion, "what does this mean? It is all courtesy
and politeness in this house; but with the vanquished good turns into
evil, and evil into worse." They entered the chief court of the castle
and found it prepared and fitted up in a style that added to their
amazement and doubled their fears, as will be seen in the following
chapter. CHAPTER LXIX. OF THE STRANGEST AND MOST EXTRAORDINARY
ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS GREAT
HISTORY The horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot,
without a moment's delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they
carried them into the court, all round which near a hundred torches
fixed in sockets were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the
corridors, so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the
want of daylight could not be perceived. In the middle of the court
was a catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered
completely by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all
round it white wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver
candlesticks. Upon the catafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel
so lovely that by her beauty she made death itself look beautiful. She
lay with her head resting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with a
garland of sweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her hands crossed
upon her bosom, and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory.
On one side of the court was erected a stage, where upon two chairs
were seated two persons who from having crowns on their heads and
sceptres in their hands appeared to be kings of some sort, whether
real or mock ones. By the side of this stage, which was reached by
steps, were two other chairs on which the men carrying the prisoners
seated Don Quixote and Sancho, all in silence, and by signs giving
them to understand that they too were to be silent; which, however,
they would have been without any signs, for their amazement at all
they saw held them tongue-tied. And now two persons of distinction,
who were at once recognised by Don Quixote as his hosts the duke and
duchess, ascended the stage attended by a numerous suite, and seated
themselves on two gorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they
seemed to be. Who would not have been amazed at this? Nor was this
all, for Don Quixote had perceived that the dead body on the
catafalque was that of the fair Altisidora. As the duke and duchess
mounted the stage Don Quixote and Sancho rose and made them a profound
obeisance, which they returned by bowing their heads slightly. At this
moment an official crossed over, and approaching Sancho threw over him
a robe of black buckram painted all over with flames of fire, and
taking off his cap put upon his head a mitre such as those undergoing
the sentence of the Holy Office wear; and whispered in his ear that he
must not open his lips, or they would put a gag upon him, or take his
life. Sancho surveyed himself from head to foot and saw himself all
ablaze with flames; but as they did not burn him, he did not care two
farthings for them. He took off the mitre and seeing painted with
devils he put it on again, saying to himself, "Well, so far those
don't burn me nor do these carry me off." Don Quixote surveyed him
too, and though fear had got the better of his faculties, he could not
help smiling to see the figure Sancho presented. And now from
underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, there rose a low sweet sound
of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice (for there silence
itself kept silence), had a soft and languishing effect. Then, beside
the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body, suddenly appeared a
fair youth in a Roman habit, who, to the accompaniment of a harp which
he himself played, sang in a sweet and clear voice these two stanzas:
While fair Altisidora, who the sport Of cold Don Quixote's cruelty
hath been, Returns to life, and in this magic court The dames in
sables come to grace the scene, And while her matrons all in seemly
sort My lady robes in baize and bombazine, Her beauty and her sorrows
will I sing With defter quill than touched the Thracian string. But
not in life alone, methinks, to me Belongs the office; Lady, when my
tongue Is cold in death, believe me, unto thee My voice shall raise
its tributary song. My soul, from this strait prison-house set free,
As o'er the Stygian lake it floats along, Thy praises singing still
shall hold its way, And make the waters of oblivion stay. At this
point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, "Enough,
enough, divine singer! It would be an endless task to put before us
now the death and the charms of the peerless Altisidora, not dead as
the ignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in
the penance which Sancho Panza, here present, has to undergo to
restore her to the long-lost light. Do thou, therefore, O
Rhadamanthus, who sittest in judgment with me in the murky caverns of
Dis, as thou knowest all that the inscrutable fates have decreed
touching the resuscitation of this damsel, announce and declare it at
once, that the happiness we look forward to from her restoration be no
longer deferred." No sooner had Minos the fellow judge of Rhadamanthus
said this, than Rhadamanthus rising up said: "Ho, officials of this
house, high and low, great and small, make haste hither one and all,
and print on Sancho's face four-and-twenty smacks, and give him twelve
pinches and six pin thrusts in the back and arms; for upon this
ceremony depends the restoration of Altisidora." On hearing this
Sancho broke silence and cried out, "By all that's good, I'll as soon
let my face be smacked or handled as turn Moor. Body o' me! What has
handling my face got to do with the resurrection of this damsel? 'The
old woman took kindly to the blits; they enchant Dulcinea, and whip me
in order to disenchant her; Altisidora dies of ailments God was
pleased to send her, and to bring her to life again they must give me
four-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my body with pins, and
raise weals on my arms with pinches! Try those jokes on a
brother-in-law; 'I'm an old dog, and "tus, tus" is no use with me.'"
"Thou shalt die," said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; "relent, thou
tiger; humble thyself, proud Nimrod; suffer and be silent, for no
impossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire into
the difficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thou
shalt see thyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl. Ho, I
say, officials, obey my orders; or by the word of an honest man, ye
shall see what ye were born for." At this some six duennas, advancing
across the court, made their appearance in procession, one after the
other, four of them with spectacles, and all with their right hands
uplifted, showing four fingers of wrist to make their hands look
longer, as is the fashion now-a-days. No sooner had Sancho caught
sight of them than, bellowing like a bull, he exclaimed, "I might let
myself be handled by all the world; but allow duennas to touch me--not
a bit of it! Scratch my face, as my master was served in this very
castle; run me through the body with burnished daggers; pinch my arms
with red-hot pincers; I'll bear all in patience to serve these
gentlefolk; but I won't let duennas touch me, though the devil should
carry me off!" Here Don Quixote, too, broke silence, saying to Sancho,
"Have patience, my son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all
thanks to heaven that it has infused such virtue into thy person, that
by its sufferings thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to
life the dead." The duennas were now close to Sancho, and he, having
become more tractable and reasonable, settling himself well in his
chair presented his face and beard to the first, who delivered him a
smack very stoutly laid on, and then made him a low curtsey. "Less
politeness and less paint, senora duenna," said Sancho; "by God your
hands smell of vinegar-wash." In fine, all the duennas smacked him and
several others of the household pinched him; but what he could not
stand was being pricked by the pins; and so, apparently out of
patience, he started up out of his chair, and seizing a lighted torch
that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the whole set of his
tormentors, exclaiming, "Begone, ye ministers of hell; I'm not made of
brass not to feel such out-of-the-way tortures." At this instant
Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long lying on her
back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders cried out almost
with one voice, "Altisidora is alive! Altisidora lives!" Rhadamanthus
bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in view was now
attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went on his knees
to Sancho saying to him, "Now is the time, son of my bowels, not to
call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those lashes
thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Now, I
say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed
with efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee." To which
Sancho made answer, "That's trick upon trick, I think, and not honey
upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come now, on
the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings! You had better take a
big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; I should
not mind it much, if I'm to be always made the cow of the wedding for
the cure of other people's ailments. Leave me alone; or else by God
I'll fling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may." Altisidora
had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did so the
clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all
present exclaiming, "Long life to Altisidora! long life to
Altisidora!" The duke and duchess and the kings Minos and Rhadamanthus
stood up, and all, together with Don Quixote and Sancho, advanced to
receive her and take her down from the catafalque; and she, making as
though she were recovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke
and duchess and to the kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote,
said to him, "God forgive thee, insensible knight, for through thy
cruelty I have been, to me it seems, more than a thousand years in the
other world; and to thee, the most compassionate upon earth, I render
thanks for the life I am now in possession of. From this day forth,
friend Sancho, count as thine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon
thee, to make as many shirts for thyself, and if they are not all
quite whole, at any rate they are all clean." Sancho kissed her hands
in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre in his hand. The duke bade
them take it from him, and give him back his cap and doublet and
remove the flaming robe. Sancho begged the duke to let them leave him
the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them home for a token and
memento of that unexampled adventure. The duchess said they must leave
them with him; for he knew already what a great friend of his she was.
The duke then gave orders that the court should be cleared, and that
all should retire to their chambers, and that Don Quixote and Sancho
should be conducted to their old quarters. CHAPTER LXX. WHICH FOLLOWS
SIXTY-NINE AND DEALS WITH MATTERS INDISPENSABLE FOR THE CLEAR
COMPREHENSION OF THIS HISTORY CHAPTER LXXI OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON
QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE SANCHO ON THE WAY TO THEIR VILLAGE The
vanquished and afflicted Don Quixote went along very downcast in one
respect and very happy in another. His sadness arose from his defeat,
and his satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in
Sancho, as had been proved by the resurrection of Altisidora; though
it was with difficulty he could persuade himself that the love-smitten
damsel had been really dead. Sancho went along anything but cheerful,
for it grieved him that Altisidora had not kept her promise of giving
him the smocks; and turning this over in his mind he said to his
master, "Surely, senor, I'm the most unlucky doctor in the world;
there's many a physician that, after killing the sick man he had to
cure, requires to be paid for his work, though it is only signing a
bit of a list of medicines, that the apothecary and not he makes up,
and, there, his labour is over; but with me though to cure somebody
else costs me drops of blood, smacks, pinches, pinproddings, and
whippings, nobody gives me a farthing. Well, I swear by all that's
good if they put another patient into my hands, they'll have to grease
them for me before I cure him; for, as they say, 'it's by his singing
the abbot gets his dinner;' and then you may at once proceed on your
journey, free and unhindered, with a safe-conduct which I shall give
you, so that if you come across any other bands of mine that I have
scattered in these parts, they may do you no harm; for I have no
intention of doing injury to soldiers, or to any woman, especially one
of quality." Profuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with
which the captains thanked Roque for his courtesy and generosity; for
such they regarded his leaving them their own money. Senora Dona
Guiomar de Quinones wanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss
the feet and hands of the great Roque, but he would not suffer it on
any account; so far from that, he begged her pardon for the wrong he
had done her under pressure of the inexorable necessities of his
unfortunate calling. The regent's lady ordered one of her servants to
give the eighty crowns that had been assessed as her share at once,
for the captains had already paid down their sixty. The pilgrims were
about to give up the whole of their little hoard, but Roque bade them
keep quiet, and turning to his men he said, "Of these crowns two fall
to each man and twenty remain over; let ten be given to these
pilgrims, and the other ten to this worthy squire that he may be able
to speak favourably of this adventure;" and then having writing
materials, with which he always went provided, brought to him, he gave
them in writing a safe-conduct to the leaders of his bands; and
bidding them farewell let them go free and filled with admiration at
his magnanimity, his generous disposition, and his unusual conduct,
and inclined to regard him as an Alexander the Great rather than a
notorious robber. One of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon
and Catalan, "This captain of ours would make a better friar than
highwayman; if he wants to be so generous another time, let it be with
his own property and not ours." The unlucky wight did not speak so low
but that Roque overheard him, and drawing his sword almost split his
head in two, saying, "That is the way I punish impudent saucy
fellows." They were all taken aback, and not one of them dared to
utter a word, such deference did they pay him. Roque then withdrew to
one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his at Barcelona, telling
him that the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called 'The
Knight of the Rueful Countenance.'" Don Quixote had by this time
placed himself on his knees beside Sancho, and, with eyes starting out
of his head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding her whom Sancho called
queen and lady; and as he could see nothing in her except a village
lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she was platter-faced and
snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did not venture to
open his lips. The country girls, at the same time, were astonished to
see these two men, so different in appearance, on their knees,
preventing their companion from going on. She, however, who had been
stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and testily, "Get out of the
way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we are in a hurry." To
which Sancho returned, "Oh, princess and universal lady of El Toboso,
is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and prop
of knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?" On
hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, "Woa then! why, I'm rubbing
thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlings come to
make game of the village girls now, as if we here could not chaff as
well as themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will
be better for you." "Get up, Sancho," said Don Quixote at this; "I see
that fortune, 'with evil done to me unsated still,' has taken
possession of all the roads by which any comfort may reach 'this
wretched soul' that I carry in my flesh. And thou, highest perfection
of excellence that can be desired, utmost limit of grace in human
shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart that adores thee, though
the malign enchanter that persecutes me has brought clouds and
cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them only, transformed thy
unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into those of a poor
peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same time changed mine into
those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy sight, refuse
not to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing in this
submission that I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the
humility with which my soul adores thee." "Hey-day! My grandfather!"
cried the girl, "much I care for your love-making! Get out of the way
and let us pass, and we'll thank you." Sancho stood aside and let her
go, very well pleased to have got so well out of the hobble he was in.
The instant the village lass who had done duty for Dulcinea found
herself free, prodding her "cackney" with a spike she had at the end
of a stick, she set off at full speed across the field. The she-ass,
however, feeling the point more acutely than usual, began cutting such
capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to the ground; seeing which,
Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho to fix and girth the
pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass's belly. The
pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to lift up his
enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast, the lady,
getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going back a
little, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of
the ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and
sat astride like a man, whereat Sancho said, "Rogue! but our lady is
lighter than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest Cordovan or
Mexican how to mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump,
and without spurs she is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her
damsels are no way behind her, for they all fly like the wind;" which
was the truth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they pushed
on after her, and sped away without looking back, for more than half a
league. Don Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no
longer in sight, he turned to Sancho and said, "How now, Sancho? thou
seest how I am hated by enchanters! And see to what a length the
malice and spite they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the
happiness it would give me to see my lady in her own proper form. The
fact is I was born to be an example of misfortune, and the target and
mark at which the arrows of adversity are aimed and directed. Observe
too, Sancho, that these traitors were not content with changing and
transforming my Dulcinea, but they transformed and changed her into a
shape as mean and ill-favoured as that of the village girl yonder; and
at the same time they robbed her of that which is such a peculiar
property of ladies of distinction, that is to say, the sweet fragrance
that comes of being always among perfumes and flowers. For I must tell
thee, Sancho, that when I approached to put Dulcinea upon her hackney
(as thou sayest it was, though to me it appeared a she-ass), she gave
me a whiff of raw garlic that made my head reel, and poisoned my very
heart." "O scum of the earth!" cried Sancho at this, "O miserable,
spiteful enchanters! O that I could see you all strung by the gills,
like sardines on a twig! Ye know a great deal, ye can do a great deal,
and ye do a great deal more. It ought to have been enough for you, ye
scoundrels, to have changed the pearls of my lady's eyes into oak
galls, and her hair of purest gold into the bristles of a red ox's
tail, and in short, all her features from fair to foul, without
meddling with her smell; for by that we might somehow have found out
what was hidden underneath that ugly rind; though, to tell the truth,
I never perceived her ugliness, but only her beauty, which was raised
to the highest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip,
like a moustache, with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold,
and more than a palm long." "From the correspondence which exists
between those of the face and those of the body," said Don Quixote,
"Dulcinea must have another mole resembling that on the thick of the
thigh on that side on which she has the one on her ace; but hairs of
the length thou hast mentioned are very long for moles." "Well, all I
can say is there they were as plain as could be," replied Sancho. "I
believe it, my friend," returned Don Quixote; "for nature bestowed
nothing on Dulcinea that was not perfect and well-finished; and so, if
she had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described, in her they
would not be moles, but moons and shining stars. But tell me, Sancho,
that which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thou wert fixing it,
was it a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?" "It was neither," replied
Sancho, "but a jineta saddle, with a field covering worth half a
kingdom, so rich is it." "And that I could not see all this, Sancho!"
said Don Quixote; "once more I say, and will say a thousand times, I
am the most unfortunate of men." Sancho, the rogue, had enough to do
to hide his laughter, at hearing the simplicity of the master he had
so nicely befooled. At length, after a good deal more conversation had
passed between them, they remounted their beasts, and followed the
road to Saragossa, which they expected to reach in time to take part
in a certain grand festival which is held every year in that
illustrious city; but before they got there things happened to them,
so many, so important, and so strange, that they deserve to be
recorded and read, as will be seen farther on. CHAPTER XI. OF THE
STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE CAR OR
CART OF "THE CORTES OF DEATH" Dejected beyond measure did Don Quixote
pursue his journey, turning over in his mind the cruel trick the
enchanters had played him in changing his lady Dulcinea into the vile
shape of the village lass, nor could he think of any way of restoring
her to her original form; and these reflections so absorbed him, that
without being aware of it he let go Rocinante's bridle, and he,
perceiving the liberty that was granted him, stopped at every step to
crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded. Sancho recalled
him from his reverie. "Melancholy, senor," said he, "was made, not for
beasts, but for men; but if men give way to it overmuch they turn to
beasts; control yourself, your worship; be yourself again; gather up
Rocinante's reins; cheer up, rouse yourself and show that gallant
spirit that knights-errant ought to have. What the devil is this? What
weakness is this? Are we here or in France? The devil fly away with
all the Dulcineas in the world; for the well-being of a single
knight-errant is of more consequence than all the enchantments and
transformations on earth." "Hush, Sancho," said Don Quixote in a weak
and faint voice, "hush and utter no blasphemies against that enchanted
lady; for I alone am to blame for her misfortune and hard fate; her
calamity has come of the hatred the wicked bear me." "So say I,"
returned Sancho; "his heart rend in twain, I trow, who saw her once,
to see her now." "Thou mayest well say that, Sancho," replied Don
Quixote, "as thou sawest her in the full perfection of her beauty; for
the enchantment does not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide
her loveliness from thee; against me alone and against my eyes is the
strength of its venom directed. Nevertheless, there is one thing which
has occurred to me, and that is that thou didst ill describe her
beauty to me, for, as well as I recollect, thou saidst that her eyes
were pearls; but eyes that are like pearls are rather the eyes of a
sea-bream than of a lady, and I am persuaded that Dulcinea's must be
green emeralds, full and soft, with two rainbows for eyebrows; take
away those pearls from her eyes and transfer them to her teeth; for
beyond a doubt, Sancho, thou hast taken the one for the other, the
eyes for the teeth." "Very likely," said Sancho; "for her beauty
bewildered me as much as her ugliness did your worship; but let us
leave it all to God, who alone knows what is to happen in this vale of
tears, in this evil world of ours, where there is hardly a thing to be
found without some mixture of wickedness, roguery, and rascality. But
one thing, senor, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is
thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or
some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the
beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor
wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them
wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my
lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street
they won't know her any more than they would my father." "Perhaps,
Sancho," returned Don Quixote, "the enchantment does not go so far as
to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of
recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the
first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by
commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to
them in this respect." "I declare, I think what your worship has
proposed is excellent," said Sancho; "and that by this plan we shall
find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your
worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers;
but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part
will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our
adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the
best physician for these and greater ailments." Don Quixote was about
to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the
road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that
could be imagined. He who led the mules and acted as carter was a
hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt or cane
roof, and the first figure that presented itself to Don Quixote's eyes
was that of Death itself with a human face; next to it was an angel
with large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to
all appearance of gold, on his head. At the feet of Death was the god
called Cupid, without his bandage, but with his bow, quiver, and
arrows; there was also a knight in full armour, except that he had no
morion or helmet, but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours;
and along with these there were others with a variety of costumes and
faces. All this, unexpectedly encountered, took Don Quixote somewhat
aback, and struck terror into the heart of Sancho; but the next
instant Don Quixote was glad of it, believing that some new perilous
adventure was presenting itself to him, and under this impression, and
with a spirit prepared to face any danger, he planted himself in front
of the cart, and in a loud and menacing tone, exclaimed, "Carter, or
coachman, or devil, or whatever thou art, tell me at once who thou
art, whither thou art going, and who these folk are thou carriest in
thy wagon, which looks more like Charon's boat than an ordinary cart."
To which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, "Senor, we
are players of Angulo el Malo's company; we have been acting the play
of 'The Cortes of Death' this morning, which is the octave of Corpus
Christi, in a village behind that hill, and we have to act it this
afternoon in that village which you can see from this; and as it is so
near, and to save the trouble of undressing and dressing again, we go
in the costumes in which we perform. That lad there appears as Death,
that other as an angel, that woman, the manager's wife, plays the
queen, this one the soldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and I
am one of the principal characters of the play, for in this company I
take the leading parts. If you want to know anything more about us,
ask me and I will answer with the utmost exactitude, for as I am a
devil I am up to everything." "By the faith of a knight-errant,"
replied Don Quixote, "when I saw this cart I fancied some great
adventure was presenting itself to me; but I declare one must touch
with the hand what appears to the eye, if illusions are to be avoided.
God speed you, good people; keep your festival, and remember, if you
demand of me ought wherein I can render you a service, I will do it
gladly and willingly, for from a child I was fond of the play, and in
my youth a keen lover of the actor's art." While they were talking,
fate so willed it that one of the company in a mummers' dress with a
great number of bells, and armed with three blown ox-bladders at the
end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrew approaching Don
Quixote, began flourishing his stick and banging the ground with the
bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the bells, which
untoward apparition so startled Rocinante that, in spite of Don
Quixote's efforts to hold him in, taking the bit between his teeth he
set off across the plain with greater speed than the bones of his
anatomy ever gave any promise of. Sancho, who thought his master was
in danger of being thrown, jumped off Dapple, and ran in all haste to
help him; but by the time he reached him he was already on the ground,
and beside him was Rocinante, who had come down with his master, the
usual end and upshot of Rocinante's vivacity and high spirits. But the
moment Sancho quitted his beast to go and help Don Quixote, the
dancing devil with the bladders jumped up on Dapple, and beating him
with them, more by the fright and the noise than by the pain of the
blows, made him fly across the fields towards the village where they
were going to hold their festival. Sancho witnessed Dapple's career
and his master's fall, and did not know which of the two cases of need
he should attend to first; but in the end, like a good squire and good
servant, he let his love for his master prevail over his affection for
his ass; though every time he saw the bladders rise in the air and
come down on the hind quarters of his Dapple he felt the pains and
terrors of death, and he would have rather had the blows fall on the
apples of his own eyes than on the least hair of his ass's tail. In
this trouble and perplexity he came to where Don Quixote lay in a far
sorrier plight than he liked, and having helped him to mount
Rocinante, he said to him, "Senor, the devil has carried off my
Dapple." "What devil?" asked Don Quixote. "The one with the bladders,"
said Sancho. "Then I will recover him," said Don Quixote, "even if he
be shut up with him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell.
Follow me, Sancho, for the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it
I will make good the loss of Dapple." "You need not take the trouble,
senor," said Sancho; "keep cool, for as I now see, the devil has let
Dapple go and he is coming back to his old quarters;" and so it turned
out, for, having come down with Dapple, in imitation of Don Quixote
and Rocinante, the devil made off on foot to the town, and the ass
came back to his master. "For all that," said Don Quixote, "it will be
well to visit the discourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the
cart, even if it were the emperor himself." "Don't think of it, your
worship," returned Sancho; "take my advice and never meddle with
actors, for they are a favoured class; I myself have known an actor
taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free; remember that,
as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyone favours and
protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above all when they
are those of the royal companies and under patent, all or most of whom
in dress and appearance look like princes." "Still, for all that,"
said Don Quixote, "the player devil must not go off boasting, even if
the whole human race favours him." So saying, he made for the cart,
which was now very near the town, shouting out as he went, "Stay!
halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to teach you how to treat asses
and animals that serve the squires of knights-errant for steeds." So
loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord opening the
gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran to see who
was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined him.
Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry,
suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone seeing
her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and down he
came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers,
who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted
so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and rising
to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and
in a loud voice exclaimed to those who stood by, "Now, noble company,
ye shall see how important it is that there should be knights in the
world professing the of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by
the deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there,
whether knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation," and so
saying he brought his legs to bear on Rocinante--for he had no
spurs--and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history we
never read of Rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter the
penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent
him. But it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the
shouts of Sancho calling after him, "Where are you going, Senor Don
Quixote? What devils have possessed you to set you on against our
Catholic faith? Plague take me! mind, that is a procession of
penitents, and the lady they are carrying on that stand there is the
blessed image of the immaculate Virgin. Take care what you are doing,
senor, for this time it may be safely said you don't know what you are
about." Sancho laboured in vain, for his master was so bent on coming
to quarters with these sheeted figures and releasing the lady in black
that he did not hear a word; and even had he heard, he would not have
turned back if the king had ordered him. He came up with the
procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already anxious enough to
slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited voice he exclaimed,
"You who hide your faces, perhaps because you are not good subjects,
pay attention and listen to what I am about to say to thee thou wilt
be led to see the great error thou wouldst commit. "Tell me, Anselmo,
if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master and lawful owner of a
diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence and purity of which
all the lapidaries that had seen it had been satisfied, saying with
one voice and common consent that in purity, quality, and fineness, it
was all that a stone of the kind could possibly be, thou thyself too
being of the same belief, as knowing nothing to the contrary, would it
be reasonable in thee to desire to take that diamond and place it
between an anvil and a hammer, and by mere force of blows and strength
of arm try if it were as hard and as fine as they said? And if thou
didst, and if the stone should resist so silly a test, that would add
nothing to its value or reputation; and if it were broken, as it might
be, would not all be lost? Undoubtedly it would, leaving its owner to
be rated as a fool in the opinion of all. Consider, then, Anselmo my
friend, that Camilla is a diamond of the finest quality as well in thy
estimation as in that of others, and that it is contrary to reason to
expose her to the risk of being broken; for if she remains intact she
cannot rise to a higher value than she now possesses; and if she give
way and be unable to resist, bethink thee now how thou wilt be
deprived of her, and with what good reason thou wilt complain of
thyself for having been the cause of her ruin and thine own. Remember
there is no jewel in the world so precious as a chaste and virtuous
woman, and that the whole honour of women consists in reputation; and
since thy wife's is of that high excellence that thou knowest,
wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth in question? Remember,
my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and that impediments are
not to be placed in her way to make her trip and fall, but that they
should be removed, and her path left clear of all obstacles, so that
without hindrance she may run her course freely to attain the desired
perfection, which consists in being virtuous. Naturalists tell us that
the ermine is a little animal which has a fur of purest white, and
that when the hunters wish to take it, they make use of this artifice.
Having ascertained the places which it frequents and passes, they stop
the way to them with mud, and then rousing it, drive it towards the
spot, and as soon as the ermine comes to the mud it halts, and allows
itself to be taken captive rather than pass through the mire, and
spoil and sully its whiteness, which it values more than life and
liberty. The virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine, and whiter and
purer than snow is the virtue of modesty; and he who wishes her not to
lose it, but to keep and preserve it, must adopt a course different
from that employed with the ermine; he must not put before her the
mire of the gifts and attentions of persevering lovers, because
perhaps--and even without a perhaps--she may not have sufficient
virtue and natural strength in herself to pass through and tread under
foot these impediments; they must be removed, and the brightness of
virtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put before her. A
virtuous woman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal,
liable to be tarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it. She
must be treated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must be
protected and prized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of
roses and flowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or
pluck a blossom; enough for others that from afar and through the iron
grating they may enjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me
repeat to thee some verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a
modern comedy, and it seems to me they bear upon the point we are
discussing. A prudent old man was giving advice to another, the father
of a young girl, to lock her up, watch over her and keep her in
seclusion, and among other arguments he used these: Woman is a thing
of glass; But her brittleness 'tis best Not too curiously to test: Who
knows what may come to pass? Breaking is an easy matter, And it's
folly to expose What you cannot mend to blows; What you can't make
whole to shatter. This, then, all may hold as true, And the reason's
plain to see; For if Danaes there be, There are golden showers too.
"All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to
what concerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of
what regards myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth
into which thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me
extricate thee makes it necessary. "Thou dost reckon me thy friend,
and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a thing wholly inconsistent with
friendship; and not only dost thou aim at this, but thou wouldst have
me rob thee of it also. That thou wouldst rob me of it is clear, for
when Camilla sees that I pay court to her as thou requirest, she will
certainly regard me as a man without honour or right feeling, since I
attempt and do a thing so much opposed to what I owe to my own
position and thy friendship. That thou wouldst have me rob thee of it
is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I press my suit upon her,
will suppose that I have perceived in her something light that has
encouraged me to make known to her my base desire; and if she holds
herself dishonoured, her dishonour touches thee as belonging to her;
and hence arises what so commonly takes place, that the husband of the
adulterous woman, though he may not be aware of or have given any
cause for his wife's failure in her duty, or (being careless or
negligent) have had it in his power to prevent his dishonour,
nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile and reproachful name, and in a
manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead of pity by all who know
of his wife's guilt, though they see that he is unfortunate not by his
own fault, but by the lust of a vicious consort. But I will tell thee
why with good reason dishonour attaches to the husband of the unchaste
wife, though he know not that she is so, nor be to blame, nor have
done anything, or given any provocation to make her so; and be not
weary with listening to me, for it will be for thy good. "When God
created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy Scripture
says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept took a rib
from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and when Adam
awoke and beheld her he said, 'This is flesh of my flesh, and bone of
my bone.' And God said 'For this shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted
the divine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can
loose them. And such is the force and virtue of this miraculous
sacrament that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh;
and even more than this when the virtuous are married; for though they
have two souls they have but one will. And hence it follows that as
the flesh of the wife is one and the same with that of her husband the
stains that may come upon it, or the injuries it incurs fall upon the
husband's flesh, though he, as has been said, may have given no cause
for them; for as the pain of the foot or any member of the body is
felt by the whole body, because all is one flesh, as the head feels
the hurt to the ankle without having caused it, so the husband, being
one with her, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all worldly
honour or dishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring wife's is
of that kind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and be held
dishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou art
encountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort;
see for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse up
passions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife;
reflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thou
wilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words to
express it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thy
vile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour
and misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thy
friendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive." Having said this,
the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and Anselmo, troubled in
mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while to utter a word in
reply; but at length he said, "I have listened, Lothario my friend,
attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast chosen to say to me,
and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I have seen that high
intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection of true friendship
thou hast reached; and likewise I see and confess that if I am not
guided by thy opinion, but follow my own, I am flying from the good
and pursuing the evil. This being so, thou must remember that I am now
labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes suffer from, when
the craving seizes them to eat clay, plaster, charcoal, and things
even worse, disgusting to look at, much more to eat; so that it will
be necessary to have recourse to some artifice to cure me; and this
can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a beginning, even though
it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion, to pay court to Camilla,
who will not be so yielding that her virtue will give way at the first
attack: with this mere attempt I shall rest satisfied, and thou wilt
have done what our friendship binds thee to do, not only in giving me
life, but in persuading me not to discard my honour. And this thou art
bound to do for one reason alone, that, being, as I am, resolved to
apply this test, it is not for thee to permit me to reveal my weakness
to another, and so imperil that honour thou art striving to keep me
from losing; and if thine may not stand as high as it ought in the
estimation of Camilla while thou art paying court to her, that is of
little or no importance, because ere long, on finding in her that
constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her the plain truth as
regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her esteem; and as
thou art venturing so little, and by the venture canst afford me so
much satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if further
difficulties present themselves to thee; for, as I have said, if thou
wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue decided."
Lothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing
what further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to
dissuade him from it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide his
pernicious scheme to some one else, to avoid a greater evil resolved
to gratify him and do what he asked, intending to manage the business
so as to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in
reply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other, for he
would undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as he
pleased. Anselmo embraced him warmly and affectionately, and thanked
him for his offer as if he had bestowed some great favour upon him;
and it was agreed between them to set about it the next day, Anselmo
affording opportunity and time to Lothario to converse alone with
Camilla, and furnishing him with money and jewels to offer and present
to her. He suggested, too, that he should treat her to music, and
write verses in her praise, and if he was unwilling to take the
trouble of composing them, he offered to do it himself. Lothario
agreed to all with an intention very different from what Anselmo
supposed, and with this understanding they returned to Anselmo's
house, where they found Camilla awaiting her husband anxiously and
uneasily, for he was later than usual in returning that day. Lothario
repaired to his own house, and Anselmo remained in his, as well
satisfied as Lothario was troubled in mind; for he could see no
satisfactory way out of this ill-advised business. That night,
however, he thought of a plan by which he might deceive Anselmo
without any injury to Camilla. The next day he went to dine with his
friend, and was welcomed by Camilla, who received and treated him with
great cordiality, knowing the affection her husband felt for him. When
dinner was over and the cloth removed, Anselmo told Lothario to stay
there with Camilla while he attended to some pressing business, as he
would return in an hour and a half. Camilla begged him not to go, and
Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing could persuade Anselmo,
who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain waiting for him as he
had a matter of great importance to discuss with him. At the same time
he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until he came back. In
short he contrived to put so good a face on the reason, or the folly,
of his absence that no one could have suspected it was a pretence.
Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone
at the table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner.
Lothario saw himself in the lists according to his friend's wish, and
facing an enemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of
armed knights; judge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he
did was to lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon
his hand, and, asking Camilla's pardon for his ill manners, he said he
wished to take a little sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply
said he could repose more at his ease in the reception-room than in
his chair, and begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario
declined, and there he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo,
who finding Camilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined
that he had stayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough
for conversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until
Lothario should wake up, that he might go out with him and question
him as to his success. Everything fell out as he wished; Lothario
awoke, and the two at once left the house, and Anselmo asked what he
was anxious to know, and Lothario in answer told him that he had not
thought it advisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and
therefore had only extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that
all the city spoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this
seemed to him an excellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and
render her disposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus
availing himself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would
deceive one who is on the watch; for he being the angel of darkness
transforms himself into an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair
seeming, discloses himself at length, and effects his purpose if at
the beginning his wiles are not discovered. All this gave great
satisfaction to Anselmo, and he said he would afford the same
opportunity every day, but without leaving the house, for he would
find things to do at home so that Camilla should not detect the plot.
Thus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a
word to Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and
that he had never been able to draw from her the slightest indication
of consent to anything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of
hope; on the contrary, he said she would inform her husband of it. "So
far well," said Anselmo; "Camilla has thus far resisted words; we must
now see how she will resist deeds. I will give you to-morrow two
thousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as many
more to buy jewels to lure her, for women are fond of being becomingly
attired and going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they are
beautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she resists this
temptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble."
Lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the
undertaking to the end, though he perceived he was to come out of it
wearied and vanquished. The next day he received the four thousand
crowns, and with them four thousand perplexities, for he knew not what
to say by way of a new falsehood; but in the end he made up his mind
to tell him that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as
against words, and that there was no use in taking any further
trouble, for the time was all spent to no purpose. But chance,
directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that Anselmo,
having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions, shut
himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen through
the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for more
than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor would
utter a word though he were to be there for an age; and he came to the
conclusion that what his friend had told him about the replies of
Camilla was all invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were
so, he came out, and calling Lothario aside asked him what news he had
and in what humour Camilla was. Lothario replied that he was not
disposed to go on with the business, for she had answered him so
angrily and harshly that he had no heart to say anything more to her.
"Ah, Lothario, Lothario," said Anselmo, "how ill dost thou meet thy
obligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I have
been just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou
has not said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former
occasions thou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no
doubt it is, what a fool Quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses
and jewels Camacho must have given her and will give her, and take
Basilio's bar-throwing and sword-play. They won't give a pint of wine
at the tavern for a good cast of the bar or a neat thrust of the
sword. Talents and accomplishments that can't be turned into money,
let Count Dirlos have them; but when such gifts fall to one that has
hard cash, I wish my condition of life was as becoming as they are. On
a good foundation you can raise a good building, and the best
foundation in the world is money." "For God's sake, Sancho," said Don
Quixote here, "stop that harangue; it is my belief, if thou wert
allowed to continue all thou beginnest every instant, thou wouldst
have no time left for eating or sleeping; for thou wouldst spend it
all in talking." "If your worship had a good memory," replied Sancho,
"you would remember the articles of our agreement before we started
from home this last time; one of them was that I was to be let say all
I liked, so long as it was not against my neighbour or your worship's
authority; and so far, it seems to me, I have not broken the said
article." "I remember no such article, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "and
even if it were so, I desire you to hold your tongue and come along;
for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to
enliven the valleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place
in the cool of the morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon."
Sancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on Rocinante
and the pack-saddle on Dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely
pace entered the arcade. The first thing that presented itself to
Sancho's eyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in the
fire at which it was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sized
mountain of faggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had
not been made in the ordinary mould of common pots, for they were six
half wine-jars, each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house;
they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides
without showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons.
Countless were the hares ready skinned and the plucked fowls that hung
on the trees for burial in the pots, numberless the wildfowl and game
of various sorts suspended from the branches that the air might keep
them cool. Sancho counted more than sixty wine skins of over six
gallons each, and all filled, as it proved afterwards, with generous
wines. There were, besides, piles of the whitest bread, like the heaps
of corn one sees on the threshing-floors. There was a wall made of
cheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two cauldrons full of oil,
bigger than those of a dyer's shop, served for cooking fritters, which
when fried were taken out with two mighty shovels, and plunged into
another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by. Of cooks and
cook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe. In the
capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking-pigs,
which, sewn up there, served to give it tenderness and flavour. The
spices of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the
pound but by the quarter, and all lay open to view in a great chest.
In short, all the preparations made for the wedding were in rustic
style, but abundant enough to feed an army. Sancho observed all,
contemplated all, and everything won his heart. The first to captivate
and take his fancy were the pots, out of which he would have very
gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful; then the wine skins
secured his affections; and lastly, the produce of the frying-pans,
if, indeed, such imposing cauldrons may be called frying-pans; and
unable to control himself or bear it any longer, he approached one of
the busy cooks and civilly but hungrily begged permission to soak a
scrap of bread in one of the pots; to which the cook made answer,
"Brother, this is not a day on which hunger is to have any sway,
thanks to the rich Camacho; get down and look about for a ladle and
skim off a hen or two, and much good may they do you." "I don't see
one," said Sancho. "Wait a bit," said the cook; "sinner that I am! how
particular and bashful you are!" and so saying, he seized a bucket and
plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple
of geese, and said to Sancho, "Fall to, friend, and take the edge off
your appetite with these skimmings until dinner-time comes." "I have
nothing to put them in," said Sancho. "Well then," said the cook,
"take spoon and all; for Camacho's wealth and happiness furnish
everything." While Sancho fared thus, Don Quixote was watching the
entrance, at one end of the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in
holiday and gala dress, mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich
handsome field trappings and a number of little bells attached to
their petrals, who, marshalled in regular order, ran not one but
several courses over the meadow, with jubilant shouts and cries of
"Long live Camacho and Quiteria! he as rich as she is fair; and she
the fairest on earth!" Hearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, "It
is easy to see these folk have never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for
if they had they would be more moderate in their praises of this
Quiteria of theirs." Shortly after this, several bands of dancers of
various sorts began to enter the arcade at different points, and among
them one of sword-dancers composed of some four-and-twenty lads of
gallant and high-spirited mien, clad in the finest and whitest of
linen, and with handkerchiefs embroidered in various colours with fine
silk; and one of those on the mares asked an active youth who led them
if any of the dancers had been wounded. "As yet, thank God, no one has
been wounded," said he, "we are all safe and sound;" and he at once
began to execute complicated figures with the rest of his comrades,
with so many turns and so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote
was well used to see dances of the same kind, he thought he had never
seen any so good as this. He also admired another that came in
composed of fair young maidens, none of whom seemed to be under
fourteen or over eighteen years of age, all clad in green stuff, with
their locks partly braided, partly flowing loose, but all of such
bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams, and over them they wore
garlands of jessamine, roses, amaranth, and honeysuckle. At their head
were a venerable old man and an ancient dame, more brisk and active,
however, than might have been expected from their years. The notes of
a Zamora bagpipe accompanied them, and with modesty in their
countenances and in their eyes, and lightness in their feet, they
looked the best dancers in the world. Following these there came an
artistic dance of the sort they call "speaking dances." It was
composed of eight nymphs in two files, with the god Cupid leading one
and Interest the other, the former furnished with wings, bow, quiver
and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of gold and silk of divers
colours. The nymphs that followed Love bore their names written on
white parchment in large letters on their backs. "Poetry" was the name
of the first, "Wit" of the second, "Birth" of the third, and "Valour"
of the fourth. Those that followed Interest were distinguished in the
same way; the badge of the first announced "Liberality," that of the
second "Largess," the third "Treasure," and the fourth "Peaceful
Possession." In front of them all came a wooden castle drawn by four
wild men, all clad in ivy and hemp stained green, and looking so
natural that they nearly terrified Sancho. On the front of the castle
and on each of the four sides of its frame it bore the inscription
"Castle of Caution." Four skillful tabor and flute players accompanied
them, and the dance having been opened, Cupid, after executing two
figures, raised his eyes and bent his bow against a damsel who stood
between the turrets of the castle, and thus addressed her: I am the
mighty God whose sway Is potent over land and sea. The heavens above
us own me; nay, The shades below acknowledge me. I know not fear, I
have my will, Whate'er my whim or fancy be; For me there's no
impossible, I order, bind, forbid, set free. Having concluded the
stanza he discharged an arrow at the top of the castle, and went back
to his place. Interest then came forward and went through two more
figures, and as soon as the tabors ceased, he said: But mightier than
Love am I, Though Love it be that leads me on, Than mine no lineage is
more high, Or older, underneath the sun. To use me rightly few know
how, To act without me fewer still, For I am Interest, and I vow For
evermore to do thy will. Interest retired, and Poetry came forward,
and when she had gone through her figures like the others, fixing her
eyes on the damsel of the castle, she said: With many a fanciful
conceit, Fair Lady, winsome Poesy Her soul, an offering at thy feet,
Presents in sonnets unto thee. If thou my homage wilt not scorn, Thy
fortune, watched by envious eyes, On wings of poesy upborne Shall be
exalted to the skies. Poetry withdrew, and on the side of Interest
Liberality advanced, and after having gone through her figures, said:
To give, while shunning each extreme, The sparing hand, the over-free,
Therein consists, so wise men deem, The virtue Liberality. But thee,
fair lady, to enrich, Myself a prodigal I'll prove, A vice not wholly
shameful, which May find its fair excuse in love. In the same manner
all the characters of the two bands advanced and retired, and each
executed its figures, and delivered its verses, some of them graceful,
some burlesque, but Don Quixote's memory (though he had an excellent
one) only carried away those that have been just quoted. All then
mingled together, forming chains and breaking off again with graceful,
unconstrained gaiety; and whenever Love passed in front of the castle
he shot his arrows up at it, while Interest broke gilded pellets
against it. At length, after they had danced a good while, Interest
drew out a great purse, made of the skin of a large brindled cat and
to all appearance full of money, and flung it at the castle, and with
the force of the blow the boards fell asunder and tumbled down,
leaving the damsel exposed and unprotected. Interest and the
characters of his band advanced, and throwing a great chain of gold
over her neck pretended to take her and lead her away captive, on
seeing which, Love and his supporters made as though they would
release her, the whole action being to the accompaniment of the tabors
and in the form of a regular dance. The wild men made peace between
them, and with great dexterity readjusted and fixed the boards of the
castle, and the damsel once more ensconced herself within; and with
this the dance wound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders. Don
Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and
arranged it. She replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had
a nice taste in devising things of the sort. "I will lay a wager,"
said Don Quixote, "that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater
friend of Camacho's than of Basilio's, and that he is better at satire
than at vespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of Basilio and
the riches of Camacho very neatly into the dance." Sancho Panza, who
was listening to all this, exclaimed, "The king is my cock; I stick to
Camacho." "It is easy to see thou art a clown, Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "and one of that sort that cry 'Long life to the conqueror.'"
"I don't know of what sort I am," returned Sancho, "but I know very
well I'll never get such elegant skimmings off Basilio's pots as these
I have got off Camacho's;" and he showed him the bucketful of geese
and hens, and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite,
saying, "A fig for the accomplishments of Basilio! As much as thou
hast so much art thou worth, and as much as thou art worth so much
hast thou. As a grandmother of mine used to say, there are only two
families in the world, the Haves and the Haven'ts; and she stuck to
the Haves; and to this day, Senor Don Quixote, people would sooner
feel the pulse of 'Have,' than of 'Know;' an ass covered with gold
looks better than a horse with a pack-saddle. So once more I say I
stick to Camacho, the bountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and
hens, hares and rabbits; but of Basilio's, if any ever come to hand,
or even to foot, they'll be only rinsings." "Hast thou finished thy
harangue, Sancho?" said Don Quixote. "Of course I have finished it,"
replied Sancho, "because I see your worship takes offence at it; but
if it was not for that, there was work enough cut out for three days."
"God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho," said Don
Quixote. "At the rate we are going," said Sancho, "I'll be chewing
clay before your worship dies; and then, maybe, I'll be so dumb that
I'll not say a word until the end of the world, or, at least, till the
day of judgment." "Even should that happen, O Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "thy silence will never come up to all thou hast talked, art
talking, and wilt talk all thy life; moreover, it naturally stands to
reason, that my death will come before thine; so I never expect to see
thee dumb, not even when thou art drinking or sleeping, and that is
the utmost I can say." "In good faith, senor," replied Sancho,
"there's no trusting that fleshless one, I mean Death, who devours the
lamb as soon as the sheep, and, as I have heard our curate say, treads
with equal foot upon the lofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of
the poor. That lady is more mighty than dainty, she is no way
squeamish, she devours all and is ready for all, and fills her
alforjas with people of all sorts, ages, and ranks. She is no reaper
that sleeps out the noontide; at all times she is reaping and cutting
down, as well the dry grass as the green; she never seems to chew, but
bolts and swallows all that is put before her, for she has a canine
appetite that is never satisfied; and though she has no belly, she
shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of all that
live, as one would drink a jug of cold water." "Say no more, Sancho,"
said Don Quixote at this; "don't try to better it, and risk a fall;
for in truth what thou hast said about death in thy rustic phrase is
what a good preacher might have said. I tell thee, Sancho, if thou
hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou mightst take a pulpit
in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons." "He preaches
well who lives well," said Sancho, "and I know no more theology than
that." "Nor needst thou," said Don Quixote, "but I cannot conceive or
make out how it is that, the fear of God being the beginning of
wisdom, thou, who art more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest so
much." "Pass judgment on your chivalries, senor," returned Sancho,
"and don't set yourself up to judge of other men's fears or braveries,
for I am as good a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave me to
despatch these skimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we
shall be called to account for in the other world;" and so saying, he
began a fresh attack on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that
he aroused Don Quixote's, who no doubt would have helped him had he
not been prevented by what must be told farther on. CHAPTER XXI. IN
WHICH CAMACHO'S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER DELIGHTFUL INCIDENTS
CHAPTER XXII WHERIN IS RELATED THE GRAND ADVENTURE OF THE CAVE OF
MONTESINOS IN THE HEART OF LA MANCHA, WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE
BROUGHT TO A HAPPY TERMINATION Many and great were the attentions
shown to Don Quixote by the newly married couple, who felt themselves
under an obligation to him for coming forward in defence of their
cause; and they exalted his wisdom to the same level with his courage,
rating him as a Cid in arms, and a Cicero in eloquence. Worthy Sancho
enjoyed himself for three days at the expense of the pair, from whom
they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme arranged with the
fair Quiteria, but a device of Basilio's, who counted on exactly the
result they had seen; he confessed, it is true, that he had confided
his idea to some of his friends, so that at the proper time they might
aid him in his purpose and insure the success of the deception.
"That," said Don Quixote, "is not and ought not to be called deception
which aims at virtuous ends;" and the marriage of lovers he maintained
to be a most excellent end, reminding them, however, that love has no
greater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is all gaiety,
enjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in the
possession of the object of his love, and poverty and want are the
declared enemies of all these; which he said to urge Senor Basilio to
abandon the practice of those accomplishments he was skilled in, for
though they brought him fame, they brought him no money, and apply
himself to the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry, which
will never fail those who are prudent and persevering. The poor man
who is a man of honour (if indeed a poor man can be a man of honour)
has a jewel when he has a fair wife, and if she is taken from him, his
honour is taken from him and slain. The fair woman who is a woman of
honour, and whose husband is poor, deserves to be crowned with the
laurels and crowns of victory and triumph. Beauty by itself attracts
the desires of all who behold it, and the royal eagles and birds of
towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure; but if beauty be
accompanied by want and penury, then the ravens and the kites and
other birds of prey assail it, and she who stands firm against such
attacks well deserves to be called the crown of her husband.
"Remember, O prudent Basilio," added Don Quixote, "it was the opinion
of a certain sage, I know not whom, that there was not more than one
good woman in the whole world; and his advice was that each one should
think and believe that this one good woman was his own wife, and in
this way he would live happy. I myself am not married, nor, so far,
has it ever entered my thoughts to be so; nevertheless I would venture
to give advice to anyone who might ask it, as to the mode in which he
should seek a wife such as he would be content to marry. The first
thing I would recommend him, would be to look to good name rather than
to wealth, for a good woman does not win a good name merely by being
good, but by letting it be seen that she is so, and open looseness and
freedom do much more damage to a woman's honour than secret depravity.
If you take a good woman into your house it will be an easy matter to
keep her good, and even to make her still better; but if you take a
bad one you will find it hard work to mend her, for it is no very easy
matter to pass from one extreme to another. I do not say it is
impossible, but I look upon it as difficult." Sancho, listening to all
this, said to himself, "This master of mine, when I say anything that
has weight and substance, says I might take a pulpit in hand, and go
about the world preaching fine sermons." "He preaches well who lives
well," said Sancho, "and I know no more theology than that." "Nor
needst thou," said Don Quixote, "but I cannot conceive or make out how
it is that, the fear of God being the beginning of wisdom, thou, who
art more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest so much." "Pass
judgment on your chivalries, senor," returned Sancho, "and don't set
yourself up to judge of other men's fears or braveries, for I am as
good a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave me to despatch these
skimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called
to account for in the other world;" and so saying, he began a fresh
attack on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that he aroused Don
Quixote's, who no doubt would have helped him had he not been
prevented by what must be told farther on. CHAPTER XXI. IN WHICH
CAMACHO'S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER DELIGHTFUL INCIDENTS While
Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the
last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were
uttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop,
shouting, to receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching
with musical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and
accompanied by the priest and the relatives of both, and all the most
distinguished people of the surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the
bride, he exclaimed, "By my faith, she is not dressed like a country
girl, but like some fine court lady; egad, as well as I can make out,
the patena she wears rich coral, and her green Cuenca stuff is
thirty-pile velvet; and then the white linen trimming--by my oath, but
it's satin! Look at her hands--jet rings on them! May I never have
luck if they're not gold rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as
white as a curdled milk, and every one of them worth an eye of one's
head! Whoreson baggage, what hair she has! if it's not a wig, I never
saw longer or fairer all the days of my life. See how bravely she
bears herself--and her shape! Wouldn't you say she was like a walking
palm tree loaded with clusters of dates? for the trinkets she has
hanging from her hair and neck look just like them. I swear in my
heart she is a brave lass, and fit 'to pass over the banks of
Flanders.'" Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's boorish eulogies and
thought that, saving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a
more beautiful woman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which
was, no doubt, because of the bad night brides always pass dressing
themselves out for their wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards
a theatre that stood on one side of the meadow decked with carpets and
boughs, where they were to plight their troth, and from which they
were to behold the dances and plays; but at the moment of their
arrival at the spot they heard a loud outcry behind them, and a voice
exclaiming, "Wait a little, ye, as inconsiderate as ye are hasty!" At
these words all turned round, and perceived that the speaker was a man
clad in what seemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson
patches like flames. He was crowned (as was presently seen) with a
crown of gloomy cypress, and in his hand he held a long staff. As he
approached he was recognised by everyone as the gay Basilio, and all
waited anxiously to see what would come of this talk which he could
not understand; but when he perceived the wench struggling to get free
and Don Quixote striving to hold her, not relishing the joke he raised
his arm and delivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the
amorous knight that he bathed all his mouth in blood, and not content
with this he mounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over
them at a pace rather smarter than a trot. The bed which was somewhat
crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable to support the additional
weight of the carrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of
this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some
brawl of Maritornes', because after calling loudly to her he got no
answer. With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to
the quarter where he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that
her master was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible,
frightened and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who
still slept, and crouching upon it made a ball of herself. The
innkeeper came in exclaiming, "Where art thou, strumpet? Of course
this is some of thy work." At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass
almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to
distribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon
Maritornes, who, irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside,
paid back so many in return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of
himself. He then, finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not,
raising himself up as well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and
he and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in
the world. The carrier, however, perceiving by the light of the
innkeeper candle how it fared with his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote,
ran to bring her the help she needed; and the innkeeper did the same
but with a different intention, for his was to chastise the lass, as
he believed that beyond a doubt she alone was the cause of all the
harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope to
stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him, and the
innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did not give
themselves a moment's rest; and the best of it was that the
innkeeper's lamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all
laid on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was
not a sound spot left where a hand could light. It so happened that
there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrillero of what they
call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also hearing the
extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the tin case
with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room crying:
"Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the name of the Holy
Brotherhood!" The first that he came upon was the pummelled Don
Quixote, who lay stretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down
bed, and, his hand falling on the beard as he felt about, he continued
to cry, "Help for the Jurisdiction!" but perceiving that he whom he
had laid hold of did not move or stir, he concluded that he was dead
and that those in the room were his murderers, and with this suspicion
he raised his voice still higher, calling out, "Shut the inn gate; see
that no one goes out; they have killed a man here!" This cry startled
them all, and each dropped the contest at the point at which the voice
reached him. The innkeeper retreated to his room, the carrier to his
pack-saddles, the lass to her crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho
alone were unable to move from where they were. The cuadrillero on
this let go Don Quixote's beard, and went out to look for a light to
search for and apprehend the culprits; but not finding one, as the
innkeeper had purposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his
room, he was compelled to have recourse to the hearth, where after
much time and trouble he lit another lamp. CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH ARE
CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON QUIXOTE AND HIS
GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO HIS MISFORTUNE
HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE By this time Don Quixote had recovered from his
swoon; and in the same tone of voice in which he had called to his
squire the day before when he lay stretched "in the vale of the
stakes," he began calling to him now, "Sancho, my friend, art thou
asleep? sleepest thou, friend Sancho?" "How can I sleep, curses on
it!" returned Sancho discontentedly and bitterly, "when it is plain
that all the devils have been at me this night?" "Thou mayest well
believe that," answered Don Quixote, "because, either I know little,
or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know-but this that I am now
about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until after my
death." "I swear it," answered Sancho. "I say so," continued Don
Quixote, "because I hate taking away anyone's good name." "I say,"
replied Sancho, "that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the end
of your worship's days, and God grant I may be able to let it out
tomorrow." "Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho," said Don Quixote,
"that thou wouldst mount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without
danger." "To tell the truth," returned Sancho, "the monstrous nose of
that squire has filled me with fear and terror, and I dare not stay
near him." "It is," said Don Quixote, "such a one that were I not what
I am it would terrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou
wilt." While Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree
he of the Mirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and,
supposing Don Quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any
sound of trumpet or other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse,
which was not more agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his
top speed, which was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy;
seeing him, however, engaged in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and
halted in mid career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was
already unable to go. Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was coming
down upon him flying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante's lean
flanks and made him scud along in such style that the history tells us
that on this occasion only was he known to make something like
running, for on all others it was a simple trot with him; and with
this unparalleled fury he bore down where he of the Mirrors stood
digging his spurs into his horse up to buttons, without being able to
make him stir a finger's length from the spot where he had come to a
standstill in his course. At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote
came upon his adversary, in trouble with his horse, and embarrassed
with his lance, which he either could not manage, or had no time to
lay in rest. Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these
difficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and without any risk
encountered him of the Mirrors with such force that he brought him to
the ground in spite of himself over the haunches of his horse, and
with so heavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not stirring
hand or foot. The instant Sancho saw him fall he slid down from the
cork tree, and made all haste to where his master was, who,
dismounting from Rocinante, went and stood over him of the Mirrors,
and unlacing his helmet to see if he was dead, and to give him air if
he should happen to be alive, he saw--who can say what he saw, without
filling all who hear it with astonishment, wonder, and awe? He saw,
the history says, the very countenance, the very face, the very look,
the very physiognomy, the very effigy, the very image of the bachelor
Samson Carrasco! As soon as he saw it he called out in a loud voice,
"Make haste here, Sancho, and behold what thou art to see but not to
believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic can do, and wizards and
enchanters are capable of." Sancho came up, and when he saw the
countenance of the bachelor Carrasco, he fell to crossing himself a
thousand times, and blessing himself as many more. All this time the
prostrate knight showed no signs of life, and Sancho said to Don
Quixote, "It is my opinion, senor, that in any case your worship
should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of this one here that
looks like the bachelor Samson Carrasco; perhaps in him you will kill
one of your enemies, the enchanters." "Thy advice is not bad," said
Don Quixote, "for of enemies the fewer the better;" and he was drawing
his sword to carry into effect Sancho's counsel and suggestion, when
the squire of the Mirrors came up, now without the nose which had made
him so hideous, and cried out in a loud voice, "Mind what you are
about, Senor Don Quixote; that is your friend, the bachelor Samson
Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I am his squire." "And the nose?"
said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature he had before; to
which he replied, "I have it here in my pocket," and putting his hand
into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose of varnished
pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho, examining him
more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of amazement, "Holy
Mary be good to me! Isn't it Tom Cecial, my neighbour and gossip?"
"Why, to be sure I am!" returned the now unnosed squire; "Tom Cecial I
am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I'll tell you presently the
means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but
in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch,
maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his
feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised
bachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman." At this moment he of
the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote perceiving it, held the
naked point of his sword over his face, and said to him, "You are a
dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless Dulcinea del
Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty; and in addition to
this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter and fall,
to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself before her on my
behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and if
she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and
seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a
guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may have passed
between you and her-conditions which, in accordance with what we
stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of
knight-errantry." "I confess," said the fallen knight, "that the dirty
tattered shoe of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the
ill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to
return from her presence to yours, and to give you a full and
particular account of all you demand of me." "You must also confess
and believe," added Don Quixote, "that the knight you vanquished was
not and could not be Don Quixote of La Mancha, but some one else in
his likeness, just as I confess and believe that you, though you seem
to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not so, but some other
resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before me in his shape,
in order that I may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my wrath,
and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory." "I confess, hold,
and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and think it," the
crippled knight; "let me rise, I entreat you; if, indeed, the shock of
my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight enough."
Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom
Cecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put
questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was
really and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on
Sancho's mind by what his master said about the enchanters having
changed the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the
bachelor Samson Carrasco, would not permit him to believe what he saw
with his eyes. In fine, both master and man remained under the
delusion; and, down in the mouth, and out of luck, he of the Mirrors
and his squire parted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he meaning to go
look for some village where he could plaster and strap his ribs. Don
Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the
history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knight of the
Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were. CHAPTER XV. WHEREIN IT IS TOLD
AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS SQUIRE WERE Don
Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest
degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he
fancied him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he
expected to learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued;
inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of
ceasing to be one, to return and render him an account of what took
place between him and her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the
Mirrors of another, for he just then had no thought of anything but
finding some village where he could plaster himself, as has been said
already. The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor
Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his knight-errantry
which he had laid aside, it was in consequence of having been
previously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to
be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet
without worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures; at which
consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on the
special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go,
as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sally
forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for
there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that
being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and
settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor.
Then, Don Quixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command
him to return to his village and his house, and not quit it for two
years, or until he received further orders from him; all which it was
clear Don Quixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or
fail to observe the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his
seclusion he might perhaps forget his folly, or there might be an
opportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his madness. Carrasco
undertook the task, and Tom Cecial, a gossip and neighbour of Sancho
Panza's, a lively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his
squire. Carrasco armed himself in the fashion described, and Tom
Cecial, that he might not be known by his gossip when they met, fitted
on over his own natural nose the false masquerade one that has been
mentioned; and so they followed the same route Don Quixote took, and
almost came up with him in time to be present at the adventure of the
cart of Death and finally encountered them in the grove, where all
that the sagacious reader has been reading about took place; and had
it not been for the millers, who plunged in and hoisted them both out,
it would have been Troy town with the pair of them. As soon as, more
drenched than thirsty, they were landed, Sancho went down on his knees
and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven, prayed a long and
fervent prayer to God to deliver him evermore from the rash projects
and attempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of the boat,
which the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeing
it smashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for it
from Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing had
happened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for the
bark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him, free
and unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castle
of theirs. "What persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman?
Art thou for carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these
mills?" "That's enough," said Don Quixote to himself, "it would be
preaching in the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble
to do any virtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters
must have encountered one another, and one frustrates what the other
attempts; one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God
help us, this world is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes
one with the other. I can do no more." And then turning towards the
mills he said aloud, "Friends, whoe'er ye be that are immured in that
prison, forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver
you from your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and
destined for some other knight." So saying he settled with the
fishermen, and paid fifty reals for the boat, which Sancho handed to
them very much against the grain, saying, "With a couple more bark
businesses like this we shall have sunk our whole capital." The
fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two
figures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and
were wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and
questions Don Quixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion
that they were madmen, they left them and betook themselves, the
millers to their mills, and the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixote
and Sancho returned to their beasts, and to their life of beasts, and
so ended the adventure of the enchanted bark. CHAPTER XXX. OF DON
QUIXOTE'S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR HUNTRESS They reached their beasts in
low spirits and bad humour enough, knight and squire, Sancho
particularly, for with him what touched the stock of money touched his
heart, and when any was taken from him he felt as if he was robbed of
the apples of his eyes. In fine, without exchanging a word, they
mounted and quitted the famous river, Don Quixote absorbed in thoughts
of his love, Sancho in thinking of his advancement, which just then,
it seemed to him, he was very far from securing; for, fool as he was,
he saw clearly enough that his master's acts were all or most of them
utterly senseless; and he began to cast about for an opportunity of
retiring from his service and going home some day, without entering
into any explanations or taking any farewell of him. Fortune, however,
ordered matters after a fashion very much the opposite of what he
contemplated. It so happened that the next day towards sunset, on
coming out of a wood, Don Quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow,
and at the far end of it observed some people, and as he drew nearer
saw that it was a hawking party. Coming closer, he distinguished among
them a lady of graceful mien, on a pure white palfrey or hackney
caparisoned with green trappings and a silver-mounted side-saddle. The
lady was also in green, and so richly and splendidly dressed that
splendour itself seemed personified in her. On her left hand she bore
a hawk, a proof to Don Quixote's mind that she must be some great lady
and the mistress of the whole hunting party, which was the fact; so he
said to Sancho, "Run Sancho, my son, and say to that lady on the
palfrey with the hawk that I, the Knight of the Lions, kiss the hands
of her exalted beauty, and if her excellence will grant me leave I
will go and kiss them in person and place myself at her service for
aught that may be in my power and her highness may command; and mind,
Sancho, how thou speakest, and take care not to thrust in any of thy
proverbs into thy message." "You've got a likely one here to thrust
any in!" said Sancho; "leave me alone for that! Why, this is not the
first time in my life I have carried messages to high and exalted
ladies." "Except that thou didst carry to the lady Dulcinea," said Don
Quixote, "I know not that thou hast carried any other, at least in my
service." "That is true," replied Sancho; "but pledges don't distress
a good payer, and in a house where there's plenty supper is soon
cooked; I mean there's no need of telling or warning me about
anything; for I'm ready for everything and know a little of
everything." "That I believe, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "go and good
luck to thee, and God speed thee." Sancho went off at top speed,
forcing Dapple out of his regular pace, and came to where the fair
huntress was standing, and dismounting knelt before her and said,
"Fair lady, that knight that you see there, the Knight of the Lions by
name, is my master, and I am a squire of his, and at home they call me
Sancho Panza. This same Knight of the Lions, who was called not long
since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, sends by me to say may it
please your highness to give him leave that, with your permission,
approbation, and consent, he may come and carry out his wishes, which
are, as he says and I believe, to serve your exalted loftiness and
beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will do a thing which will
redound to your honour, and he will receive a most distinguished
favour and happiness." "You have indeed, squire," said the lady,
"delivered your message with all the formalities such messages
require; rise up, for it is not right that the squire of a knight so
great as he of the Rueful Countenance, of whom we have heard a great
deal here, should remain on his knees; rise, my friend, and bid your
master welcome to the services of myself and the duke my husband, in a
country house we have here." Sancho got up, charmed as much by the
beauty of the good lady as by her high-bred air and her courtesy, but,
above all, by what she had said about having heard of his master, the
Knight of the Rueful Countenance; for if she did not call him Knight
of the Lions it was no doubt because he had so lately taken the name.
"Tell me, brother squire," asked the duchess (whose title, however, is
not known), "this master of yours, is he not one of whom there is a
history extant in print, called 'The Ingenious Gentleman, Don Quixote
of La Mancha,' who has for the lady of his heart a certain Dulcinea
del Toboso?" "He is the same, senora," replied Sancho; "and that
squire of his who figures, or ought to figure, in the said history
under the name of Sancho Panza, is myself, unless they have changed me
in the cradle, I mean in the press." "I am rejoiced at all this," said
the duchess; "go, brother Panza, and tell your master that he is
welcome to my estate, and that nothing could happen me that could give
me greater pleasure." Sancho returned to his master mightily pleased
with this gratifying answer, and told him all the great lady had said
to him, lauding to the skies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty,
her graceful gaiety, and her courtesy. Don Quixote drew himself up
briskly in his saddle, fixed himself in his stirrups, settled his
visor, gave Rocinante the spur, and with an easy bearing advanced to
kiss the hands of the duchess, who, having sent to summon the duke her
husband, told him while Don Quixote was approaching all about the
message; and as both of them had read the First Part of this history,
and from it were aware of Don Quixote's crazy turn, they awaited him
with the greatest delight and anxiety to make his acquaintance,
meaning to fall in with his humour and agree with everything he said,
and, so long as he stayed with them, to treat him as a knight-errant,
with all the ceremonies usual in the books of chivalry they had read,
for they themselves were very fond of them. Don Quixote now came up
with his visor raised, and as he seemed about to dismount Sancho made
haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but in getting down off
Dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in one of the ropes of
the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable to free it, and was
left hanging by it with his face and breast on the ground. Don
Quixote, who was not used to dismount without having the stirrup held,
fancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it for him, threw
himself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante's saddle after him,
which was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both came to the
ground; not without discomfiture to him and abundant curses muttered
between his teeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had his foot still
in the shackles. The duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help of
knight and squire, and they raised Don Quixote, sorely shaken by his
fall; and he, limping, advanced as best he could to kneel before the
noble pair. This, however, the duke would by no means permit; on the
contrary, dismounting from his horse, he went and embraced Don
Quixote, saying, "I am grieved, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,
that your first experience on my ground should have been such an
unfortunate one as we have seen; but the carelessness of squires is
often the cause of worse accidents." "That which has happened me in
meeting you, mighty prince," replied Don Quixote, "cannot be
unfortunate, even if my fall had not stopped short of the depths of
the bottomless pit, for the glory of having seen you would have lifted
me up and delivered me from it. My squire, God's curse upon him, is
better at unloosing his tongue in talking impertinence than in
tightening the girths of a saddle to keep it steady; but however I may
be, allen or raised up, on foot or on horseback, I shall always be at
your service and that of my lady the duchess, your worthy consort,
worthy queen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy." "Gently,
Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha," said the duke; "where my lady Dona
Dulcinea del Toboso is, it is not right that other beauties should be
praised." Sancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was
standing by, and before his master could answer he said, "There is no
denying, and it must be maintained, that my lady Dulcinea del Toboso
is very beautiful; but the hare jumps up where one least expects it;
and I have heard say that what we call nature is like a potter that
makes vessels of clay, and he who makes one fair vessel can as well
make two, or three, or a hundred; I say so because, by my faith, my
lady the duchess is in no way behind my mistress the lady Dulcinea del
Toboso." Don Quixote turned to the duchess and said, "Your highness
may conceive that never had knight-errant in this world a more
talkative or a droller squire than I have, and he will prove the truth
of what I say, if your highness is pleased to accept of my services
for a few days." To which the duchess made answer, "that worthy Sancho
is droll I consider a very good thing, because it is a sign that he is
shrewd; for drollery and sprightliness, Senor Don Quixote, as you very
well know, do not take up their abode with dull wits; and as good
Sancho is droll and sprightly I here set him down as shrewd." "And
talkative," added Don Quixote. "So much the better," said the duke,
"for many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose
time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance-" "Of
the Lions, your highness must say," said Sancho, "for there is no
Rueful Countenance nor any such character now." "He of the Lions be
it," continued the duke; "I say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a
castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which
is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont
to give to all knights-errant who come there." By this time Sancho had
fixed and girthed Rocinante's saddle, and Don Quixote having got on
his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in
the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess desired Sancho to
come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in listening to his
shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in
between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive
such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle. CHAPTER
XXXI. WHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERS CHAPTER XXXII OF THE
REPLY DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS CENSURER, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS, GRAVE AND
DROLL CHAPTER XXXIII OF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND
HER DAMSELS HELD WITH SANCHO PANZA, WELL WORTH READING AND NOTING The
history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in order
to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit the
duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit down
beside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding,
wanted not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was to sit
down as governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was worthy
of even the chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador. Sancho shrugged
his shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess's damsels and
duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what
he would say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying:
"Now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us,
I should be glad if the senor governor would relieve me of certain
doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that
is now in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea,
I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, to have the vanquished your
worship sends or will send coming to her and going down on their knees
before her? Because may be when they came she'd be hackling flax or
threshing on the threshing floor, and they'd be ashamed to see her,
and she'd laugh, or resent the present." "I have before now told thee
many times, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "that thou art a mighty great
chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thou art always striving at
sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art and how rational I
am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thou must know that a
certain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, and above all free
and easy, fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay-brother; his
superior came to know of it, and one day said to the worthy widow by
way of brotherly remonstrance, 'I am surprised, senora, and not
without good reason, that a woman of such high standing, so fair, and
so rich as you are, should have fallen in love with such a mean, low,
stupid fellow as So-and-so, when in this house there are so many
masters, graduates, and divinity students from among whom you might
choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying this one I'll take, that
I won't take;' but she replied to him with great sprightliness and
candour, 'My dear sir, you are very much mistaken, and your ideas are
very old-fashioned, if you think that I have made a bad choice in
So-and-so, fool as he seems; because for all I want with him he knows
as much and more philosophy than Aristotle.' In the same way, Sancho,
for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the
most exalted princess on earth. It is not to be supposed that all
those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they
give them, had any such mistresses. Thinkest thou that the
Amarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the Dianas, the Galateas, the
Filidas, and all the rest of them, that the books, the ballads, the
barber's shops, the theatres are full of, were really and truly ladies
of flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and have
glorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the
most part to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may
pass for lovers, or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it
suffices me to think and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair
and virtuous; and as to her pedigree it is very little matter, for no
one will examine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon
her, and I, for my part, reckon her the most exalted princess in the
world. For thou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know, that two
things alone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are
great beauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found in
Dulcinea in the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and in
good name few approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell,
I persuade myself that all I say is as I say, neither more nor less,
and I picture her in my imagination as I would have her to be, as well
in beauty as in condition; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia
come up to her, nor any other of the famous women of times past,
Greek, Barbarian, or Latin; and let each say what he will, for if in
this I am taken to task by the ignorant, I shall not be censured by
the critical." "I say that your worship is entirely right," said
Sancho, "and that I am an ass. But I know not how the name of ass came
into my mouth, for a rope is not to be mentioned in the house of him
who has been hanged; but now for the letter, and then, God be with
you, I am off." Don Quixote took out the note-book, and, retiring to
one side, very deliberately began to write the letter, and when he had
finished it he called to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him,
so that he might commit it to memory, in case of losing it on the
road; for with evil fortune like his anything might be apprehended. To
which Sancho replied, "Write it two or three times there in the book
and give it to me, and I will carry it very carefully, because to
expect me to keep it in my memory is all nonsense, for I have such a
bad one that I often forget my own name; but for all that repeat it to
me, as I shall like to hear it, for surely it will run as if it was in
print." "Listen," said Don Quixote, "this is what it says: "DON
QUIXOTE'S LETTER TO DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO "Sovereign and exalted
Lady,--The pierced by the point of absence, the wounded to the heart's
core, sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del Toboso, the health that he
himself enjoys not. If thy beauty despises me, if thy worth is not for
me, if thy scorn is my affliction, though I be sufficiently
long-suffering, hardly shall I endure this anxiety, which, besides
being oppressive, is protracted. My good squire Sancho will relate to
thee in full, fair ingrate, dear enemy, the condition to which I am
reduced on thy account: if it be thy pleasure to give me relief, I am
thine; if not, do as may be pleasing to thee; for by ending my life I
shall satisfy thy cruelty and my desire. "Thine till death, "The
Knight of the Rueful Countenance." "By the life of my father," said
Sancho, when he heard the letter, "it is the loftiest thing I ever
heard. Body of me! how your worship says everything as you like in it!
And how well you fit in 'The Knight of the Rueful Countenance' into
the signature. I declare your worship is indeed the very devil, and
there is nothing you don't know." "Everything is needed for the
calling I follow," said Don Quixote. "Now then," said Sancho, "let
your worship put the order for the three ass-colts on the other side,
and sign it very plainly, that they may recognise it at first sight."
"With all my heart," said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sancho
had requested him, he found it ran thus: Thy false promise and my sure
misfortune carry me to a place whence the news of my death will reach
thy ears before the words of my complaint. Ungrateful one, thou hast
rejected me for one more wealthy, but not more worthy; but if virtue
were esteemed wealth I should neither envy the fortunes of others nor
weep for misfortunes of my own. What thy beauty raised up thy deeds
have laid low; by it I believed thee to be an angel, by them I know
thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast sent war to me, and
Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from thee,
so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I reap not a
revenge I would not have. When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote
said, "There is less to be gathered from this than from the verses,
except that he who wrote it is some rejected lover;" and turning over
nearly all the pages of the book he found more verses and letters,
some of which he could read, while others he could not; but they were
all made up of complaints, laments, misgivings, desires and aversions,
favours and rejections, some rapturous, some doleful. While Don
Quixote examined the book, Sancho examined the valise, not leaving a
corner in the whole of it or in the pad that he did not search, peer
into, and explore, or seam that he did not rip, or tuft of wool that
he did not pick to pieces, lest anything should escape for want of
care and pains; so keen was the covetousness excited in him by the
discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a hundred; and though
he found no more booty, he held the blanket flights, balsam vomits,
stake benedictions, carriers' fisticuffs, missing alforjas, stolen
coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and weariness he had endured in the
service of his good master, cheap at the price; as he considered
himself more than fully indemnified for all by the payment he received
in the gift of the treasure-trove. The Knight of the Rueful
Countenance was still very anxious to find out who the owner of the
valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and letter, from the
money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts, that he must be
some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his lady had
driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited and rugged
spot there was no one to be seen in all the space outside. When we
were collected together we debated whether it would be better first to
go for Zoraida, or to make prisoners of the Moorish rowers who rowed
in the vessel; but while we were still uncertain our renegade came up
asking us what kept us, as it was now the time, and all the Moors were
off their guard and most of them asleep. We told him why we hesitated,
but he said it was of more importance first to secure the vessel,
which could be done with the greatest ease and without any danger, and
then we could go for Zoraida. We all approved of what he said, and so
without further delay, guided by him we made for the vessel, and he
leaping on board first, drew his cutlass and said in Morisco, "Let no
one stir from this if he does not want it to cost him his life." By
this almost all the Christians were on board, and the Moors, who were
fainthearted, hearing their captain speak in this way, were cowed, and
without any one of them taking to his arms (and indeed they had few or
hardly any) they submitted without saying a word to be bound by the
Christians, who quickly secured them, threatening them that if they
raised any kind of outcry they would be all put to the sword. This
having been accomplished, and half of our party being left to keep
guard over them, the rest of us, again taking the renegade as our
guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato's garden, and as good luck would
have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily as if it had not been
locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, we reached the house
without being perceived by anybody. The lovely Zoraida was watching
for us at a window, and as soon as she perceived that there were
people there, she asked in a low voice if we were "Nizarani," as much
as to say or ask if we were Christians. I answered that we were, and
begged her to come down. As soon as she recognised me she did not
delay an instant, but without answering a word came down immediately,
opened the door and presented herself before us all, so beautiful and
so richly attired that I cannot attempt to describe her. The moment I
saw her I took her hand and kissed it, and the renegade and my two
comrades did the same; and the rest, who knew nothing of the
circumstances, did as they saw us do, for it only seemed as if we were
returning thanks to her, and recognising her as the giver of our
liberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco language if her father
was in the house. She replied that he was and that he was asleep.
"Then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us," said
the renegade, "and everything of value in this fair mansion." "Nay,"
said she, "my father must not on any account be touched, and there is
nothing in the house except what I shall take, and that will be quite
enough to enrich and satisfy all of you; wait a little and you shall
see," and so saying she went in, telling us she would return
immediately and bidding us keep quiet making any noise. I asked the
renegade what had passed between them, and when he told me, I declared
that nothing should be done except in accordance with the wishes of
Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of gold crowns
that she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her father awoke while
this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came to the
window, and at once perceiving that all those who were there were
Christians, raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call out
in Arabic, "Christians, Christians! thieves, thieves!" by which cries
we were all thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but the
renegade seeing the danger we were in and how important it was for him
to effect his purpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost
quickness to where Hadji Morato was, and with him went some of our
party; I, however, did not dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen
almost fainting in my arms. To be brief, those who had gone upstairs
acted so promptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji
Morato with his hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth, which
prevented him from uttering a word, warning him at the same time that
to attempt to speak would cost him his life. When his daughter caught
sight of him she covered her eyes so as not to see him, and her father
was horror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she had placed herself
in our hands. But it was now most essential for us to be on the move,
and carefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where those who had
remained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of some mishap
having befallen us. It was barely two hours after night set in when we
were all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from the
hands of Zoraida's father, and the napkin from his mouth; but the
renegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take
his life. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously,
and still more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and
that she lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any
reluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry
into effect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him.
Finding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with
the oars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound,
bade the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moors
and setting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herself
in the sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be
carried away captive before her eyes and on her account. The renegade
repeated this to me, and I replied that I was very willing to do so;
but he replied that it was not advisable, because if they were left
there they would at once raise the country and stir up the city, and
lead to the despatch of swift cruisers in pursuit, and our being
taken, by sea or land, without any possibility of escape; and that all
that could be done was to set them free on the first Christian ground
we reached. On this point we all agreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was
explained, together with the reasons that prevented us from doing at
once what she desired, was satisfied likewise; and then in glad
silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his
oar, and commending ourselves to God with all our hearts, we began to
shape our course for the island of Majorca, the nearest Christian
land. Owing, however, to the Tramontana rising a little, and the sea
growing somewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep a straight
course for Majorca, and we were compelled to coast in the direction of
Oran, not without great uneasiness on our part lest we should be
observed from the town of Shershel, which lies on that coast, not more
than sixty miles from Algiers. Moreover we were afraid of meeting on
that course one of the galliots that usually come with goods from
Tetuan; although each of us for himself and all of us together felt
confident that, if we were to meet a merchant galliot, so that it were
not a cruiser, not only should we not be lost, but that we should take
a vessel in which we could more safely accomplish our voyage. As we
pursued our course Zoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to
see her father, and I felt that she was praying to Lela Marien to help
us. We might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some
three musket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and
without anyone to see us. For all that, however, by hard rowing we put
out a little to sea, for it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained
about two leagues the word was given to row by batches, while we ate
something, for the vessel was well provided; but the rowers said it
was not a time to take any rest; let food be served out to those who
were not rowing, but they would not leave their oars on any account.
This was done, but now a stiff breeze began to blow, which obliged us
to leave off rowing and make sail at once and steer for Oran, as it
was impossible to make any other course. All this was done very
promptly, and under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without
any fear, except that of coming across some vessel out on a roving
expedition. We gave the Moorish rowers some food, and the renegade
comforted them by telling them that they were not held as captives, as
we should set them free on the first opportunity. The same was said to
Zoraida's father, who replied, "Anything else, Christian, I might hope
for or think likely from your generosity and good behaviour, but do
not think me so simple as to imagine you will give me my liberty; for
you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger of depriving me
of it only to restore it to me so generously, especially as you know
who I am and the sum you may expect to receive on restoring it; and if
you will only name that, I here offer you all you require for myself
and for my unhappy daughter there; or else for her alone, for she is
the greatest and most precious part of my soul." As he said this he
began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all with compassion and
forced Zoraida to look at him, and when she saw him weeping she was so
moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw her arms round him,
and pressing her face to his, they both gave way to such an outburst
of tears that several of us were constrained to keep them company. But
when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels about
her, he said to her in his own language, "What means this, my
daughter? Last night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are
plunged befell us, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and
now, without having had time to attire thyself, and without my
bringing thee any joyful tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning
and bedecking thyself, I see thee arrayed in the finest attire it
would be in my power to give thee when fortune was most kind to us.
Answer me this; for it causes me greater anxiety and surprise than
even this misfortune itself." The renegade interpreted to us what the
Moor said to his daughter; she, however, returned him no answer. But
when he observed in one corner of the vessel the little trunk in which
she used to keep her jewels, which he well knew he had left in Algiers
and had not brought to the garden, he was still more amazed, and asked
her how that trunk had come into our hands, and what there was in it.
To which the renegade, without waiting for Zoraida to reply, made
answer, "Do not trouble thyself by asking thy daughter Zoraida so many
questions, senor, for the one answer I will give thee will serve for
all; I would have thee know that she is a Christian, and that it is
she who has been the file for our chains and our deliverer from
captivity. She is here of her own free will, as glad, I imagine, to
find herself in this position as he who escapes from darkness into the
light, from death to life, and from suffering to glory." "Daughter, is
this true, what he says?" cried the Moor. "It is," replied Zoraida.
"That thou art in truth a Christian," said the old man, "and that thou
hast given thy father into the power of his enemies?" To which Zoraida
made answer, "A Christian I am, but it is not I who have placed thee
in this position, for it never was my wish to leave thee or do thee
harm, but only to do good to myself." "And what good hast thou done
thyself, daughter?" said he. "Ask thou that," said she, "of Lela
Marien, for she can tell thee better than I." The Moor had hardly
heard these words when with marvellous quickness he flung himself
headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he would have been drowned
had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a little on
the surface of the water. Zoraida cried aloud to us to save him, and
we all hastened to help, and seizing him by his robe we drew him in
half drowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in such distress
that she wept over him as piteously and bitterly as though he were
already dead. We turned him upon his face and he voided a great
quantity of water, and at the end of two hours came to himself.
Meanwhile, the wind having changed we were compelled to head for the
land, and ply our oars to avoid being driven on shore; but it was our
good fortune to reach a creek that lies on one side of a small
promontory or cape, called by the Moors that of the "Cava rumia,"
which in our language means "the wicked Christian woman;" for it is a
tradition among them that La Cava, through whom Spain was lost, lies
buried at that spot; "cava" in their language meaning "wicked woman,"
and "rumia" "Christian;" moreover, they count it unlucky to anchor
there when necessity compels them, and they never do so otherwise. For
us, however, it was not the resting-place of the wicked woman but a
haven of safety for our relief, so much had the sea now got up. We
posted a look-out on shore, and never let the oars out of our hands,
and ate of the stores the renegade had laid in, imploring God and Our
Lady with all our hearts to help and protect us, that we might give a
happy ending to a beginning so prosperous. At the entreaty of Zoraida
orders were given to set on shore her father and the other Moors who
were still bound, for she could not endure, nor could her tender heart
bear to see her father in bonds and her fellow-countrymen prisoners
before her eyes. We promised her to do this at the moment of
departure, for as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them
at that place. Our prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by
Heaven, for after a while the wind changed in our favour, and made the
sea calm, inviting us once more to resume our voyage with a good
heart. Seeing this we unbound the Moors, and one by one put them on
shore, at which they were filled with amazement; but when we came to
land Zoraida's father, who had now completely recovered his senses, he
said: "Why is it, think ye, Christians, that this wicked woman is
rejoiced at your giving me my liberty? Think ye it is because of the
affection she bears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the
hindrance my presence offers to the execution of her base designs. And
think not that it is her belief that yours is better than ours that
has led her to change her religion; it is only because she knows that
immodesty is more freely practised in your country than in ours." Then
turning to Zoraida, while I and another of the Christians held him
fast by both arms, lest he should do some mad act, he said to her,
"Infamous girl, misguided maiden, whither in thy blindness and madness
art thou going in the hands of these dogs, our natural enemies? Cursed
be the hour when I begot thee! Cursed the luxury and indulgence in
which I reared thee!" But seeing that he was not likely soon to cease
I made haste to put him on shore, and thence he continued his
maledictions and lamentations aloud; calling on Mohammed to pray to
Allah to destroy us, to confound us, to make an end of us; and when,
in consequence of having made sail, we could no longer hear what he
said we could see what he did; how he plucked out his beard and tore
his hair and lay writhing on the ground. But once he raised his voice
to such a pitch that we were able to hear what he said. "Come back,
dear daughter, come back to shore; I forgive thee all; let those men
have the money, for it is theirs now, and come back to comfort thy
sorrowing father, who will yield up his life on this barren strand if
thou dost leave him." All this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow
and tears, and all she could say in answer was, "Allah grant that Lela
Marien, who has made me become a Christian, give thee comfort in thy
sorrow, my father. Allah knows that I could not do otherwise than I
have done, and that these Christians owe nothing to my will; for even
had I wished not to accompany them, but remain at home, it would have
been impossible for me, so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the
accomplishment of this purpose, which I feel to be as righteous as to
thee, dear father, it seems wicked." But neither could her father hear
her nor we see him when she said this; and so, while I consoled
Zoraida, we turned our attention to our voyage, in which a breeze from
the right point so favoured us that we made sure of finding ourselves
off the coast of Spain on the morrow by daybreak. But, as good seldom
or never comes pure and unmixed, without being attended or followed by
some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it, our fortune, or perhaps
the curses which the Moor had hurled at his daughter (for whatever
kind of father they may come from these are always to be dreaded),
brought it about that when we were now in mid-sea, and the night about
three hours spent, as we were running with all sail set and oars
lashed, for the favouring breeze saved us the trouble of using them,
we saw by the light of the moon, which then was in its full splendour,
that some one was calling to him from the hole in the wall, which
seemed to him to be a window, and what is more, with a gilt grating,
as rich castles, such as he believed the inn to be, ought to have; and
it immediately suggested itself to his imagination that, as on the
former occasion, the fair damsel, the daughter of the lady of the
castle, overcome by love for him, was once more endeavouring to win
his affections; and with this idea, not to show himself discourteous,
or ungrateful, he turned Rocinante's head and approached the hole, and
as he perceived the two wenches he said: "I pity you, beauteous lady,
that you should have directed your thoughts of love to a quarter from
whence it is impossible that such a return can be made to you as is
due to your great merit and gentle birth, for which you must not blame
this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable of submission
to any other than her whom, the first moment his eyes beheld her, he
made absolute mistress of his soul. Forgive me, noble lady, and retire
to your apartment, and do not, by any further declaration of your
passion, compel me to show myself more ungrateful; and if, of the love
you bear me, you should find that there is anything else in my power
wherein I can gratify you, provided it be not love itself, demand it
of me; for I swear to you by that sweet absent enemy of mine to grant
it this instant, though it be that you require of me a lock of
Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or even the very beams of the sun
shut up in a vial." "My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir
knight," said Maritornes at this. "What then, discreet dame, is it
that your mistress wants?" replied Don Quixote. "Only one of your fair
hands," said Maritornes, "to enable her to vent over it the great
passion passion which has brought her to this loophole, so much to the
risk of her honour; for if the lord her father had heard her, the
least slice he would cut off her would be her ear." "I should like to
see that tried," said Don Quixote; "but he had better beware of that,
if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end that ever father
in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs of a
love-stricken daughter." Maritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would
present the hand she had asked, and making up her mind what to do, she
got down from the hole and went into the stable, where she took the
halter of Sancho Panza's ass, and in all haste returned to the hole,
just as Don Quixote had planted himself standing on Rocinante's saddle
in order to reach the grated window where he supposed the lovelorn
damsel to be; and giving her his hand, he said, "Lady, take this hand,
or rather this scourge of the evil-doers of the earth; take, I say,
this hand which no other hand of woman has ever touched, not even hers
who has complete possession of my entire body. I present it to you,
not that you may kiss it, but that you may observe the contexture of
the sinews, the close network of the muscles, the breadth and capacity
of the veins, whence you may infer what must be the strength of the
arm that has such a hand." "That we shall see presently," said
Maritornes, and making a running knot on the halter, she passed it
over his wrist and coming down from the hole tied the other end very
firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw-loft. Don Quixote, feeling
the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed, "Your grace seems
to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it not so harshly,
for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution has given you,
nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part;
remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so
cruelly." But there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don
Quixote's, for as soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other
made off, ready to die with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a
way that it was impossible for him to avoid letting out the male
without incurring the enmity of the fiery and daring knight, flung
open the doors of the first cage, containing, as has been said, the
lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size, and grim and hideous
mien. The first thing he did was to make Don Quixote take off his
armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit we have already
described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony overhanging
one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the crowd and of
the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. The cavaliers in
livery careered before him again as though it were for him alone, and
not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, and Sancho
was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew not, he
had fallen upon another Camacho's wedding, another house like Don
Diego de Miranda's, another castle like the duke's. Some of Don
Antonio's friends dined with him that day, and all showed honour to
Don Quixote and treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed
up and exalted in consequence could not contain himself for
satisfaction. Such were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants
of the house, and all who heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips.
While at table Don Antonio said to him, "We hear, worthy Sancho, that
you are so fond of manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you
have any left, you keep them in your bosom for the next day." "No,
senor, that's not true," said Sancho, "for I am more cleanly than
greedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well that we two are used
to live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. To be sure, if it
so happens that they offer me a heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I
eat what I'm given, and make use of opportunities as I find them; but
whoever says that I'm an out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me
tell him that he is wrong; and I'd put it in a different way if I did
not respect the honourable beards that are at the table." "Indeed,"
said Don Quixote, "Sancho's moderation and cleanliness in eating might
be inscribed and graved on plates of brass, to be kept in eternal
remembrance in ages to come. It is true that when he is hungry there
is a certain appearance of voracity about him, for he eats at a great
pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he is always mindful
of; and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily, so much
so that he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork."
"What!" said Don Antonio, "has Sancho been a governor?" "Ay," said
Sancho, "and of an island called Barataria. I governed it to
perfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and learned to
look down upon all the governments in the world; I got out of it by
taking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead,
and out of which I escaped alive by a miracle." Don Quixote then gave
them a minute account of the whole affair of Sancho's government, with
which he greatly amused his hearers. On the cloth being removed Don
Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand, passed with him into a
distant room in which there was nothing in the way of furniture except
a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestal of the same, upon
which was set up, after the fashion of the busts of the Roman
emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. Don Antonio traversed
the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table
several times, and then said, "Now, Senor Don Quixote, that I am
satisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I
will tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly
speaking strange things, that can be imagined, on condition that you
will keep what I say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy." "I
swear it," said Don Quixote, "and for greater security I will put a
flag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Senor Don Antonio" (he
had by this time learned his name), "that you are addressing one who,
though he has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may
safely transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely
upon it that you have consigned it to the depths of silence." "In
reliance upon that promise," said Don Antonio, "I will astonish you
with what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the
vexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets,
for they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody." Don Quixote
was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such precautions;
whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over the bronze head
and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it stood, and
then said, "This head, Senor Don Quixote, has been made and fabricated
by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever saw, a
Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo of whom
such marvellous stories are told. He was here in my house, and for a
consideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed this
head, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever
questions are put to its ear. He observed the points of the compass,
he traced figures, he studied the stars, he watched favourable
moments, and at length brought it to the perfection we shall see
to-morrow, for on Fridays it is mute, and this being Friday we must
wait till the next day. In the interval your worship may consider what
you would like to ask it; and I know by experience that in all its
answers it tells the truth." Don Quixote was amazed at the virtue and
property of the head, and was inclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but
seeing what a short time he had to wait to test the matter, he did not
choose to say anything except that he thanked him for having revealed
to him so mighty a secret. They then quitted the room, Don Antonio
locked the door, and they repaired to the chamber where the rest of
the gentlemen were assembled. In the meantime Sancho had recounted to
them several of the adventures and accidents that had happened his
master. That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in
his armour but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon
him, that at that season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were
left with the servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave
the house. Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall
mule of easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on
him, and on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a
parchment on which they wrote in large letters, "This is Don Quixote
of La Mancha." As they set out upon their excursion the placard
attracted the eyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read
out, "This is Don Quixote of La Mancha," Don Quixote was amazed to see
how many people gazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised
him, and turning to Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to
him, "Great are the privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes
him who professes it known and famous in every region of the earth;
see, Don Antonio, even the very boys of this city know me without ever
having seen me." "True, Senor Don Quixote," returned Don Antonio; "for
as fire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being
recognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms
shines distinguished above all others." It came to pass, however, that
as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the acclamations that have been
described, a Castilian, reading the inscription on his back, cried out
in a loud voice, "The devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha!
What! art thou here, and not dead of the countless drubbings that have
fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad; and if thou wert so by thyself, and
kept thyself within thy madness, it would not be so bad; but thou hast
the gift of making fools and blockheads of all who have anything to do
with thee or say to thee. Why, look at these gentlemen bearing thee
company! Get thee home, blockhead, and see after thy affairs, and thy
wife and children, and give over these fooleries that are sapping thy
brains and skimming away thy wits." "Go your own way, brother," said
Don Antonio, "and don't offer advice to those who don't ask you for
it. Senor Don Quixote is in his full senses, and we who bear him
company are not fools; virtue is to be honoured wherever it may be
found; go, and bad luck to you, and don't meddle where you are not
wanted." "By God, your worship is right," replied the Castilian; "for
to advise this good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all
that it fills me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead
has in everything should dribble away by the channel of his
knight-errantry; but may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me
and all my descendants, if, from this day forth, though I should live
longer than Methuselah, I ever give advice to anybody even if he asks
me for it." The advice-giver took himself off, and they continued
their stroll; but so great was the press of the boys and people to
read the placard, that Don Antonio was forced to remove it as if he
were taking off something else. Night came and they went home, and
there was a ladies' dancing party, for Don Antonio's wife, a lady of
rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, had invited some friends of hers to
come and do honour to her guest and amuse themselves with his strange
delusions. Several of them came, they supped sumptuously, the dance
began at about ten o'clock. Among the ladies were two of a mischievous
and frolicsome turn, and, though perfectly modest, somewhat free in
playing tricks for harmless diversion sake. These two were so
indefatigable in taking Don Quixote out to dance that they tired him
down, not only in body but in spirit. It was a sight to see the figure
Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, his garments clinging
tight to him, ungainly, and above all anything but agile. The gay
ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly repelled
them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he
lifted up his voice and exclaimed, "Fugite, partes adversae! Leave me
in peace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies, for
she who is queen of mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers
none but hers to lead me captive and subdue me;" and so saying he sat
down on the floor in the middle of the room, tired out and broken down
by all this exertion in the dance. Don Antonio directed him to be
taken up bodily and carried to bed, and the first that laid hold of
him was Sancho, saying as he did so, "In an evil hour you took to
dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men of valour are
dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? If you do, I can
tell you you are mistaken; there's many a man would rather undertake
to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been the shoe-fling you
were at I could take your place, for I can do the shoe-fling like a
gerfalcon; but I'm no good at dancing." With these and other
observations Sancho set the whole ball-room laughing, and then put his
master to bed, covering him up well so that he might sweat out any
chill caught after his dancing. The next day Don Antonio thought he
might as well make trial of the enchanted head, and with Don Quixote,
Sancho, and two others, friends of his, besides the two ladies that
had tired out Don Quixote at the ball, who had remained for the night
with Don Antonio's wife, he locked himself up in the chamber where the
head was. He explained to them the property it possessed and entrusted
the secret to them, telling them that now for the first time he was
going to try the virtue of the enchanted head; but except Don
Antonio's two friends no one else was privy to the mystery of the
enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not first revealed it to them they
would have been inevitably reduced to the same state of amazement as
the rest, so artfully and skilfully was it contrived. The first to
approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and in a low
voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said to it,
"Head, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at this
moment thinking of?" The head, without any movement of the lips,
answered in a clear and distinct voice, so as to be heard by all, "I
cannot judge of thoughts." All were thunderstruck at this, and all the
more so as they saw that there was nobody anywhere near the table or
in the whole room that could have answered. "How many of us are here?"
asked Don Antonio once more; and it was answered him in the same way
softly, "Thou and thy wife, with two friends of thine and two of hers,
and a famous knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of
his, Sancho Panza by name." Now there was fresh astonishment; now
everyone's hair was standing on end with awe; and Don Antonio retiring
from the head exclaimed, "This suffices to show me that I have not
been deceived by him who sold thee to me, O sage head, talking head,
answering head, wonderful head! Let some one else go and put what
question he likes to it." And as women are commonly impulsive and
inquisitive, the first to come forward was one of the two friends of
Don Antonio's wife, and her question was, "Tell me, Head, what shall I
do to be very beautiful?" and the answer she got was, "Be very
modest." "I question thee no further," said the fair querist. Her
companion then came up and said, "I should like to know, Head, whether
my husband loves me or not;" the answer given to her was, "Think how
he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;" and the married lady went off
saying, "That answer did not need a question; for of course the
treatment one receives shows the disposition of him from whom it is
received." Then one of Don Antonio's two friends advanced and asked
it, "Who am I?" "Thou knowest," was the answer. "That is not what I
ask thee," said the gentleman, "but to tell me if thou knowest me."
"Yes, I know thee, thou art Don Pedro Noriz," was the reply. "I do not
seek to know more," said the gentleman, "for this is enough to
convince me, O Head, that thou knowest everything;" and as he retired
the other friend came forward and asked it, "Tell me, Head, what are
the wishes of my eldest son?" "I have said already," was the answer,
"that I cannot judge of wishes; however, I can tell thee the wish of
thy son is to bury thee." "That's 'what I see with my eyes I point out
with my finger,'" said the gentleman, "so I ask no more." Don
Antonio's wife came up and said, "I know not what to ask thee, Head; I
would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many years of
enjoyment of my good husband;" and the answer she received was, "Thou
shalt, for his vigour and his temperate habits promise many years of
life, which by their intemperance others so often cut short." Then Don
Quixote came forward and said, "Tell me, thou that answerest, was that
which I describe as having happened to me in the cave of Montesinos
the truth or a dream? Will Sancho's whipping be accomplished without
fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be brought about?" "As to
the question of the cave," was the reply, "there is much to be said;
there is something of both in it. Sancho's whipping will proceed
leisurely. The disenchantment of Dulcinea will attain its due
consummation." "I seek to know no more," said Don Quixote; "let me but
see Dulcinea disenchanted, and I will consider that all the good
fortune I could wish for has come upon me all at once." The last
questioner was Sancho, and his questions were, "Head, shall I by any
chance have another government? Shall I ever escape from the hard life
of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?" To which
the answer came, "Thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou
returnest to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing
to serve thou shalt cease to be a squire." "Good, by God!" said Sancho
Panza; "I could have told myself that; the prophet Perogrullo could
have said no more." "What answer wouldst thou have, beast?" said Don
Quixote; "is it not enough that the replies this head has given suit
the questions put to it?" "Yes, it is enough," said Sancho; "but I
should have liked it to have made itself plainer and told me more."
The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with
which all were filled, except Don Antonio's two friends who were in
the secret. This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once,
not to keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some
strange magical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model
of another head, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at
Madrid, Don Antonio made this one at home for his own amusement and to
astonish ignorant people; and its mechanism was as follows. The table
was of wood painted and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal
on which it stood was of the same material, with four eagles' claws
projecting from it to support the weight more steadily. The head,
which resembled a bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured
like bronze, was hollow throughout, as was the table, into which it
was fitted so exactly that no trace of the joining was visible. The
pedestal of the table was also hollow and communicated with the throat
and neck of the head, and the whole was in communication with another
room underneath the chamber in which the head stood. Through the
entire cavity in the pedestal, table, throat and neck of the bust or
figure, there passed a tube of tin carefully adjusted and concealed
from sight. In the room below corresponding to the one above was
placed the person who was to answer, with his mouth to the tube, and
the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passed from above downwards, and from
below upwards, the words coming clearly and distinctly; it was
impossible, thus, to detect the trick. A nephew of Don Antonio's, a
smart sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as he had been told
beforehand by his uncle who the persons were that would come with him
that day into the chamber where the head was, it was an easy matter
for him to answer the first question at once and correctly; the others
he answered by guess-work, and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete
adds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve
days; but that, as it became noised abroad through the city that he
had in his house an enchanted head that answered all who asked
questions of it, Don Antonio, fearing it might come to the ears of the
watchful sentinels of our faith, explained the matter to the
inquisitors, who commanded him to break it up and have done with it,
lest the ignorant vulgar should be scandalised. By Don Quixote,
however, and by Sancho the head was still held to be an enchanted one,
and capable of answering questions, though more to Don Quixote's
satisfaction than Sancho's. The gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don
Antonio and also to do the honours to Don Quixote, and give him an
opportunity of displaying his folly, made arrangements for a tilting
at the ring in six days from that time, which, however, for reason
that will be mentioned hereafter, did not take place. Don Quixote took
a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot, for he feared
that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him; so he and
Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out for a walk.
Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don Quixote
lifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over a door,
"Books printed here," at which he was vastly pleased, for until then
he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to know what
it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them drawing
sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type here,
revising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great
printing offices. He went up to one case and asked what they were
about there; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and
passed on. He approached one man, among others, and asked him what he
was doing. The workman replied, "Senor, this gentleman here" (pointing
to a man of prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look)
"has translated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am
setting it up in type for the press." "What is the title of the book?"
asked Don Quixote; to which the author replied, "Senor, in Italian the
book is called Le Bagatelle." "And what does Le Bagatelle import in
our Spanish?" asked Don Quixote. "Le Bagatelle," said the author, "is
as though we should say in Spanish Los Juguetes; but though the book
is humble in name it has good solid matter in it." "I," said Don
Quixote, "have some little smattering of Italian, and I plume myself
on singing some of Ariosto's stanzas; but tell me, senor--I do not say
this to test your ability, but merely out of curiosity--have you ever
met with the word pignatta in your book?" "Yes, often," said the
author. "And how do you render that in Spanish?" "How should I render
it," returned the author, "but by olla?" "Body o' me," exclaimed Don
Quixote, "what a proficient you are in the Italian language! I would
lay a good wager that where they say in Italian piace you say in
Spanish place, and where they say piu you say mas, and you translate
su by arriba and giu by abajo." "I translate them so of course," said
the author, "for those are their proper equivalents." "I would venture
to swear," said Don Quixote, "that your worship is not known in the
world, which always begrudges their reward to rare wits and
praiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! What genius
thrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seems to
me that translation from one language into another, if it be not from
the queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at
Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are
visible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they
do not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side; and
translation from easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command
of words, any more than transcribing or copying out one document from
another. But I do not mean by this to draw the inference that no
credit is to be allowed for the work of translating, for a man may
employ himself in ways worse and less profitable to himself. This
estimate does not include two famous translators, Doctor Cristobal de
Figueroa, in his Pastor Fido, and Don Juan de Jauregui, in his Aminta,
wherein by their felicity they leave it in doubt which is the
translation and which the original. But tell me, are you printing this
book at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright to some
bookseller?" "I print at my own risk," said the author, "and I expect
to make a thousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to
be of two thousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals
apiece." "A fine calculation you are making!" said Don Quixote; "it is
plain you don't know the ins and outs of the printers, and how they
play into one another's hands. I promise you when you find yourself
saddled with two thousand copies you will feel so sore that it will
astonish you, particularly if the book is a little out of the common
and not in any way highly spiced." "What!" said the author, "would
your worship, then, have me give it to a bookseller who will give
three maravedis for the copyright and think he is doing me a favour? I
do not print my books to win fame in the world, for I am known in it
already by my works; I want to make money, without which reputation is
not worth a rap." "God send your worship good luck," said Don Quixote;
and he moved on to another case, where he saw them correcting a sheet
of a book with the title of "Light of the Soul;" noticing it he
observed, "Books like this, though there are many of the kind, are the
ones that deserve to be printed, for many are the sinners in these
days, and lights unnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness."
He passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and when
he asked its title they told him it was called, "The Second Part of
the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha," by one of
Tordesillas. "I have heard of this book already," said Don Quixote,
"and verily and on my conscience I thought it had been by this time
burned to ashes as a meddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come
to it as it does to every pig; for fictions have the more merit and
charm about them the more nearly they approach the truth or what looks
like it; and true stories, the truer they are the better they are;"
and so saying he walked out of the printing office with a certain
amount of displeasure in his looks. That same day Don Antonio arranged
to take him to see the galleys that lay at the beach, whereat Sancho
was in high delight, as he had never seen any all his life. Don
Antonio sent word to the commandant of the galleys that he intended to
bring his guest, the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called
'The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.'" Don Quixote had by this time
placed himself on his knees beside Sancho, and, with eyes starting out
of his head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding her whom Sancho called
queen and lady; and as he could see nothing in her except a village
lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she was platter-faced and
snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did not venture to
open his lips. The country girls, at the same time, were astonished to
see these two men, so different in appearance, on their knees,
preventing their companion from going on. She, however, who had been
stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and testily, "Get out of the
way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we are in a hurry." To
which Sancho returned, "Oh, princess and universal lady of El Toboso,
is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and prop
of knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?" On
hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, "Woa then! why, I'm rubbing
thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlings come to
make game of the village girls now, as if we here could not chaff as
well as themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will
be better for you." "Get up, Sancho," said Don Quixote at this; "I see
that fortune, 'with evil done to me unsated still,' has taken
possession of all the roads by which any comfort may reach 'this
wretched soul' that I carry in my flesh. And thou, highest perfection
of excellence that can be desired, utmost limit of grace in human
shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart that adores thee, though
the malign enchanter that persecutes me has brought clouds and
cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them only, transformed thy
unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into those of a poor
peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same time changed mine into
those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy sight, refuse
not to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing in this
submission that I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the
humility with which my soul adores thee." "Hey-day! My grandfather!"
cried the girl, "much I care for your love-making! Get out of the way
and let us pass, and we'll thank you." Sancho stood aside and let her
go, very well pleased to have got so well out of the hobble he was in.
The instant the village lass who had done duty for Dulcinea found
herself free, prodding her "cackney" with a spike she had at the end
of a stick, she set off at full speed across the field. The she-ass,
however, feeling the point more acutely than usual, began cutting such
capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to the ground; seeing which,
Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho to fix and girth the
pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass's belly. The
pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to lift up his
enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast, the lady,
getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going back a
little, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of
the ass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and
sat astride like a man, whereat Sancho said, "Rogue! but our lady is
lighter than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest Cordovan or
Mexican how to mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump,
and without spurs she is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her
damsels are no way behind her, for they all fly like the wind;" which
was the truth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they pushed
on after her, and sped away without looking back, for more than half a
league. Don Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no
longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said, "Come here, my
son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has
commanded me." "My oath on it," said Andres, "your worship will be
well advised to obey the command of that good knight--may he live a
thousand years--for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if
you do not pay me, he will come back and do as he said." "My oath on
it, too," said the farmer; "but as I have a strong affection for you,
I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;" and seizing
him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a flogging
that he left him for dead. "Now, Master Andres," said the farmer,
"call on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he won't undo that,
though I am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have a
good mind to flay you alive." But at last he untied him, and gave him
leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence pronounced
into execution. Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he
would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him
exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him
sevenfold; but for all that, he went off weeping, while his master
stood laughing. Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong,
and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered
he had made a very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he
took the road towards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a
low voice, "Well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all
on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has
fallen to thy lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and
pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La
Mancha, who, as all the world knows, yesterday received the order of
knighthood, and hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance
that ever injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day
plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly
lashing that tender child." He now came to a road branching in four
directions, and immediately he was reminded of those cross-roads where
knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take.
In imitation of them he halted for a while, and after having deeply
considered it, he gave Rocinante his head, submitting his own will to
that of his hack, who followed out his first intention, which was to
make straight for his own stable. After he had gone about two miles
Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who, as afterwards
appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to buy silk at
Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their sunshades,
with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had
Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that this must
be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could
those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one
made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing
and determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his
lance ready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting
himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these
knights-errant, for such he now considered and held them to be; and
when they had come near enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a
haughty gesture, "All the world stand, unless all the world confess
that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the Empress of La
Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso." The traders halted at the
sound of this language and the sight of the strange figure that
uttered it, and from both figure and language at once guessed the
craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly what was
the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one of
them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to
him, "Sir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak
of; show her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with
all our hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that
is on your part required of us." "If I were to show her to you,"
replied Don Quixote, "what merit would you have in confessing a truth
so manifest? The essential point is that without seeing her you must
believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend it; else ye have to do
with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabble that ye are; and
come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood requires, or all
together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed, here do I bide
and await you relying on the justice of the cause I maintain." "Sir
Knight," replied the trader, "I entreat your worship in the name of
this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our
consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard
of, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the peerless
Dulcinea's good name, a thing that is not at all becoming the
character and fidelity of a good squire?" At these words, Sancho,
without uttering one in reply, got up from his chair, and with
noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his lips, went
all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he came
back to his seat and said, "Now, senora, that I have seen that there
is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will
answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or
dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part
I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says
things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody's that listens to him,
are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself
could not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond
all question, it's my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this
is clear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that
have neither head nor tail, and yet the public listens to them with
delight, and regards and cries them up as perfection when they are so
far from it; and if the authors who write them, and the players who
act them, say that this is what they must be, for the public wants
this and will have nothing else; and that those that go by rule and
work out a plot according to the laws of art will only find some
half-dozen intelligent people to understand them, while all the rest
remain blind to the merit of their composition; and that for
themselves it is better to get bread from the many than praise from
the few; then my book will fare the same way, after I have burnt off
my eyebrows in trying to observe the principles I have spoken of, and
I shall be 'the tailor of the corner.' And though I have sometimes
endeavoured to convince actors that they are mistaken in this notion
they have adopted, and that they would attract more people, and get
more credit, by producing plays in accordance with the rules of art,
than by absurd ones, they are so thoroughly wedded to their own
opinion that no argument or evidence can wean them from it. "I
remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, 'Tell me,
do you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies
acted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were
such that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and
interest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the
higher orders, and brought in more money to the performers, these
three alone, than thirty of the best that have been since produced?'
"'No doubt,' replied the actor in question, 'you mean the "Isabella,"
the "Phyllis," and the "Alexandra."' "'Those are the ones I mean,'
said I; 'and see if they did not observe the principles of art, and
if, by observing them, they failed to show their superiority and
please all the world; so that the fault does not lie with the public
that insists upon nonsense, but with those who don't know how to
produce something else. "The Ingratitude Revenged" was not nonsense,
nor was there any in "The Numantia," nor any to be found in "The
Merchant Lover," nor yet in "The Friendly Fair Foe," nor in some
others that have been written by certain gifted poets, to their own
fame and renown, and to the profit of those that brought them out;'
some further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left him
rather dumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I could
disabuse him of his error." "You have touched upon a subject, senor
canon," observed the curate here, "that has awakened an old enmity I
have against the plays in vogue at the present day, quite as strong as
that which I bear to the books of chivalry; for while the drama,
according to Tully, should be the mirror of human life, the model of
manners, and the image of the truth, those which are presented
now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense, models of folly, and images of
lewdness. For what greater nonsense can there be in connection with
what we are now discussing than for an infant to appear in swaddling
clothes in the first scene of the first act, and in the second a
grown-up bearded man? Or what greater absurdity can there be than
putting before us an old man as a swashbuckler, a young man as a
poltroon, a lackey using fine language, a page giving sage advice, a
king plying as a porter, a princess who is a kitchen-maid? And then
what shall I say of their attention to the time in which the action
they represent may or can take place, save that I have seen a play
where the first act began in Europe, the second in Asia, the third
finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it been in four acts, the fourth
would have ended in America, and so it would have been laid in all
four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life is the main thing the
drama should keep in view, how is it possible for any average
understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed to pass in
the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principal personage in
it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered Jerusalem
with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey of Bouillon,
there being years innumerable between the one and the other? or, if
the play is based on fiction and historical facts are introduced, or
bits of what occurred to different people and at different times mixed
up with it, all, not only without any semblance of probability, but
with obvious errors that from every point of view are inexcusable? And
the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who say that this is
perfection, and that anything beyond this is affected refinement. And
then if we turn to sacred dramas--what miracles they invent in them!
What apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to one saint the
miracles of another! And even in secular plays they venture to
introduce miracles without any reason or object except that they think
some such miracle, or transformation as they call it, will come in
well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play. All this
tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of history, nay
more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreigners who
scrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarous
and ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays we
produce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief
object well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to
be performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmless
amusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which
idleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by any
sort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bind
those who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made,
since, as I say, the object sought for may be secured by any sort. To
this I would reply that the same end would be, beyond all comparison,
better attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so;
for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play, the
hearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the
serious parts, full of admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened
by the arguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the
examples, inflamed against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all
these ways a good play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he
ever so boorish or dull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is
that a play endowed with all these qualities will not entertain,
satisfy, and please much more than one wanting in them, like the
greater number of those which are commonly acted now-a-days. Nor are
the poets who write them to be blamed for this; for some there are
among them who are perfectly well aware of their faults, and know what
they ought to do; but as plays have become a salable commodity, they
say, and with truth, that the actors will not buy them unless they are
after this fashion; and so the poet tries to adapt himself to the
requirements of the actor who is to pay him for his work. And that
this is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most
fertile wit of these kingdoms has written, with so much brilliancy, so
much grace and gaiety, such polished versification, such choice
language, such profound reflections, and in a word, so rich in
eloquence and elevation of style, that he has filled the world with
his fame; and yet, in consequence of his desire to suit the taste of
the actors, they have not all, as some of them have, come as near
perfection as they ought. Others write plays with such heedlessness
that, after they have been acted, the actors have to fly and abscond,
afraid of being punished, as they often have been, for having acted
something offensive to some king or other, or insulting to some noble
family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothing of, would be
removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person at the
capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only those
produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be acted
in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local
magistracy should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors
would take care to send their plays to the capital, and could act them
in safety, and those who write them would be more careful and take
more pains with their work, standing in awe of having to submit it to
the strict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good
plays would be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained;
as well the amusement of the people, as the credit of the wits of
Spain, the interest and safety of the actors, and the saving of
trouble in inflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some
other person were authorised to examine the newly written books of
chivalry, no doubt some would appear with all the perfections you have
described, enriching our language with the gracious and precious
treasure of eloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before
the light of the new ones that would come out for the harmless
entertainment, not merely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the
bow cannot be always bent, nor can weak human nature exist without
some lawful amusement." The canon and the curate had proceeded thus
far with their conversation, when the barber, coming forward, joined
them, and said to the curate, "This is the spot, senor licentiate,
that I said was a good one for fresh and plentiful pasture for the
oxen, while we take our noontide rest." "And so it seems," returned
the curate, and he told the canon what he proposed to do, on which he
too made up his mind to halt with them, attracted by the aspect of the
fair valley that lay before their eyes; and to enjoy it as well as the
conversation of the curate, to whom he had begun to take a fancy, and
also to learn more particulars about the doings of Don Quixote, he
desired some of his servants to go on to the inn, which was not far
distant, and fetch from it what eatables there might be for the whole
party, as he meant to rest for the afternoon where he was; to which
one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule, which by this time
ought to have reached the inn, carried provisions enough to make it
unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley. "In that
case," said the canon, "take all the beasts there, and bring the
sumpter mule back." While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that
he could speak to his master without having the curate and the barber,
of whom he had his suspicions, present all the time, approached the
cage in which Don Quixote was placed, and said, "Senor, to ease my
conscience I want to tell you the state of the case as to your
enchantment, and that is that these two here, with their faces
covered, are the curate of our village and the barber; and I suspect
they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this fashion, out
of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing famous
deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted,
but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want to ask you
one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you will
be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that you are
not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits." "Ask what thou wilt,
Sancho my son," returned Don Quixote, "for I will satisfy thee and
answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest, that these who
accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our neighbours and
acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to be those same
persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact, believe it not
on any account; what thou art to believe and think is that, if they
look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who have
enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy for
enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken those
of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee
into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape though
thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it to make
me uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence this evil
comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the barber
and curate of our village are here in company with us, and on the
other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no
power on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut
me in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment
is of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the
histories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted? So
thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what
thou sayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk. But touching thy
desire to ask me something, say on, and I will answer thee, though
thou shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning." "May
Our Lady be good to me!" said Sancho, lifting up his voice; "and is it
possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of brains
that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and that
malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than
enchantment? But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are
not enchanted. Now tell me, so may God deliver you from this
affliction, and so may you find yourself when you least expect it in
the arms of my lady Dulcinea-" "Leave off conjuring me," said Don
Quixote, "and ask what thou wouldst know; I have already told thee I
will answer with all possible precision." "That is what I want," said
Sancho; "and what I would know, and have you tell me, without adding
or leaving out anything, but telling the whole truth as one expects it
to be told, and as it is told, by all who profess arms, as your
worship professes them, under the title of knights-errant-" "I tell
thee I will not lie in any particular," said Don Quixote; "finish thy
question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations,
requirements, and precautions, Sancho." "Well, I rely on the goodness
and truth of my master," said Sancho; "and so, because it bears upon
what we are talking about, I would ask, speaking with all reverence,
whether since your worship has been shut up and, as you think,
enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire or inclination to go
anywhere, as the saying is?" "I do not understand 'going anywhere,'"
said Don Quixote; "explain thyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou
wouldst have me give an answer to the point." "Is it possible," said
Sancho, "that your worship does not understand 'going anywhere'? Why,
the schoolboys know that from the time they were babes. Well then, you
must know I mean have you had any desire to do what cannot be
avoided?" "Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "yes,
often, and even this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will
not go right." CHAPTER XLIX. WHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION
WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER DON QUIXOTE "Aha, I have
caught you," said Sancho; "this is what in my heart and soul I was
longing to know. Come now, senor, can you deny what is commonly said
around us, when a person is out of humour, 'I don't know what ails
so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives a
proper answer to any question; one would think he was enchanted'? From
which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or
sleep, or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of-that such
persons are enchanted; but not those that have the desire your worship
has, and drink when drink is given them, and eat when there is
anything to eat, and answer every question that is asked them." "What
thou sayest is true, Sancho," replied Don Quixote; "but I have already
told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may be that in
the course of time they have been changed one for another, and that
now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do,
though they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw
inferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am
enchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would
weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in
a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage,
defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need
and distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid
and protection." "Still for all that," replied Sancho, "I say that,
for your greater and fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your
worship were to try to get out of this prison (and I promise to do all
in my power to help, and even to take you out of it), and see if you
could once more mount your good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted
too, he is so melancholy and dejected; and then we might try our
chance in looking for adventures again; and if we have no luck there
will be time enough to go back to the cage; in which, on the faith of
a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut myself up along with your
worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be
able to carry out my plan." "I am content to do as thou sayest,
brother Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and when thou seest an opportunity
for effecting my release I will obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt
see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thy conception of my
misfortune." The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their
conversation till they reached the place where the curate, the canon,
and the barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The
carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about
the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not
enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like
his squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the
cage for a little; for if they did not let him out, he protested he
would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they kept
their distance. The canon took his hand, tied together as they both
were, and on his word and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced
beyond measure he was to find himself out of the cage. The first thing
he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his
great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner
eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as
best he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no
closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however,
his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of
pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It
is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut,
he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which
undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with
which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to
guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron on
the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not
caring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted
it as a helmet of the most perfect construction. He next proceeded to
inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more
blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that "tantum pellis et ossa fuit,"
surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of
the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him,
because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse
belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,
should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so
as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant,
and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master
taking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should
be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and
calling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck
out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out
of his memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a
name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his
condition as a hack before he became what he now was, the first and
foremost of all the hacks in the world. Having got a name for his
horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for himself, and
he was eight days more pondering over this point, till at last he made
up his mind to call himself "Don Quixote," whence, as has been already
said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his
name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada as others
would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not
content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the
name of his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himself
Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of
his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he
considered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did
honour to it in taking his surname from it. So then, his armour being
furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and
he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that nothing more was
needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a
knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or
a body without a soul. As he said to himself, "If, for my sins, or by
my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common
occurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or
cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue
him, will it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a
present, that he may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet
lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, 'I am the giant
Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania, vanquished in single
combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La
Mancha, who rights wrongs, gives food to those who thirst and drink to
the hungry. That's all very well, but do you know her house, Sancho?
My master says it will be some royal palace or grand castle. And have
you ever seen her by any chance? Neither I nor my master ever saw her.
And does it strike you that it would be just and right if the El
Toboso people, finding out that you were here with the intention of
going to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were
to come and cudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you? They
would, indeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am
under orders, and that 'you are a messenger, my friend, no blame
belongs to you.' Don't you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan
folk are as hot-tempered as they are honest, and won't put up with
liberties from anybody. By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will
be worse for you, I promise you. Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt
fall. Why should I go looking for three feet on a cat." "'Tis you that
are the cat, rat, and rascal," replied Don Quixote, and acting on the
word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him time to
defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a
lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had
the musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this
unexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback
seized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked
Don Quixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no
doubt it would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing
the chance before them of liberating themselves, had not effected it
by contriving to break the chain on which they were strung. Such was
the confusion, that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who
were breaking loose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for
them, did nothing at all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part,
gave a helping hand to release Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first
to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking
the prostrate commissary, took from him his sword and the musket, with
which, aiming at one and levelling at another, he, without ever
discharging it, drove every one of the guards off the field, for they
took to flight, as well to escape Pasamonte's musket, as the showers
of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them.
Sancho was greatly grieved at the affair, because he anticipated that
those who had fled would report the matter to the Holy Brotherhood,
who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once sally forth in
quest of the offenders; and he said so to his master, and entreated
him to leave the place at once, and go into hiding in the sierra that
was close by. "That is all very well," said Don Quixote, "but I know
what must be done now;" and calling together all the galley slaves,
who were now running riot, and had stripped the commissary to the
skin, he collected them round him to hear what he had to say, and
addressed them as follows: "To be grateful for benefits received is
the part of persons of good birth, and one of the sins most offensive
to God is ingratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by
manifest proof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which
I desire, and it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which
I have taken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the
city of El Toboso, and there present yourselves before the lady
Dulcinea del Toboso, and say to her that her knight, he of the Rueful
Countenance, sends to commend himself to her; and that ye recount to
her in full detail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up
to the recovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go
where ye will, and good fortune attend you." Gines de Pasamonte made
answer for all, saying, "That which you, sir, our deliverer, demand of
us, is of all impossibilities the most impossible to comply with,
because we cannot go together along the roads, but only singly and
separate, and each one his own way, endeavouring to hide ourselves in
the bowels of the earth to escape the Holy Brotherhood, which, no
doubt, will come out in search of us. What your worship may do, and
fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady
Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos
which we will say for your worship's intention, and this is a
condition that can be complied with by night as by day, running or
resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that we are going now to
return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take up our chain and set
out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now night, though it is
not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us is like asking pears
of the elm tree." "Then by all that's good," said Don Quixote in high
wrath, turning upon him angrily, as his way was; "and it is a very
great slander, or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very
illustrious lady, and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a
princess would have made free with a quack; and whoever maintains the
contrary lies like a great scoundrel, and I will give him to know it,
on foot or on horseback, armed or unarmed, by night or by day, or as
he likes best." Cardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit
having now come upon him, he had no disposition to go on with his
story, nor would Don Quixote have listened to it, so much had what he
had heard about Madasima disgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up
for her as if she were in earnest his veritable born lady; to such a
pass had his unholy books brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I
said, now mad, when he heard himself given the lie, and called a
scoundrel and other insulting names, not relishing the jest, snatched
up a stone that he found near him, and with it delivered such a blow
on Don Quixote's breast that he laid him on his back. Sancho Panza,
seeing his master treated in this fashion, attacked the madman with
his closed fist; but the Ragged One received him in such a way that
with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet, and then
mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the
goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having
beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his
hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the rage he felt
at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take
vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them warning
that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known
it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves. The
goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heard
him, that was no fault of his. Sancho retorted, and the goatherd
rejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the
beard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made
peace between them, they would have knocked one another to pieces.
"Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance," said Sancho,
grappling with the goatherd, "for of this fellow, who is a clown like
myself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the
affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an
honest man." "That is true," said Don Quixote, "but I know that he is
not to blame for what has happened." With this he pacified them, and
again asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find Cardenio, as
he felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his story. The
goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that there was no
knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he wandered
about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in with him
either in or out of his senses. CHAPTER XXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE
STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF LA MANCHA IN THE
SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OF BELTENEBROS Don
Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting Rocinante
bade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very
discontentedly. They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most
rugged part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk
with his master, and longing for him to begin, so that there should be
no breach of the injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence
so long he said to him: "Senor Don Quixote, give me your worship's
blessing and dismissal, for I'd like to go home at once to my wife and
children with whom I can at any rate talk and converse as much as I
like; for to want me to go through these solitudes day and night and
not speak to you when I have a mind is burying me alive. If luck would
have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of Guisopete, it
would not be so bad, because I could talk to Rocinante about whatever
came into my head, and so put up with my ill-fortune; but it is a hard
case, and not to be borne with patience, to go seeking adventures all
one's life and get nothing but kicks and blanketings, brickbats and
punches, and with all this to have to sew up one's mouth without
daring to say what is in one's heart, just as if one were dumb." "I
understand thee, Sancho," replied Don Quixote; "thou art dying to have
the interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed,
and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains." "So
be it," said Sancho; "let me speak now, for God knows what will happen
by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask, what
made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whatever her
name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers
or not? for if your worship had let that pass--and you were not a
judge in the matter--it is my belief the madman would have gone on
with his story, and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more
than half a dozen cuffs would have been escaped." "In faith, Sancho,"
answered Don Quixote, "if thou knewest as I do what an honourable and
illustrious lady Queen Madasima was, I know thou wouldst say I had
great patience that I did not break in pieces the mouth that uttered
such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it is to say or imagine
that a queen has made free with a surgeon. The truth of the story is
that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great
prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and physician to
the queen, but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense
deserving very severe punishment; and as a proof that Cardenio did not
know what he was saying, remember when he said it he was out of his
wits." "That is what I say," said Sancho; "there was no occasion for
minding the words of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your
worship, and he had sent that stone at your head instead of at your
breast, a fine way we should have been in for standing up for my lady
yonder, God confound her! And then, would not Cardenio have gone free
as a madman?" "Against men in their senses or against madmen," said
Don Quixote, "every knight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour
of women, whoever they may be, much more for queens of such high
degree and dignity as Queen Madasima, for whom I have a particular
regard on account of her amiable qualities; for, besides being
extremely beautiful, she was very wise, and very patient under her
misfortunes, of which she had many; and the counsel and society of the
Master Elisabad were a great help and support to her in enduring her
afflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the ignorant and
ill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was his
mistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and will lie two hundred
times more, all who think and say so." "I neither say nor think so,"
said Sancho; "let them look to it; with their bread let them eat it;
they have rendered account to God whether they misbehaved or not; I
come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I am not fond of prying into
other men's lives; he who buys and lies feels it in his purse;
moreover, naked was I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor
gain.'" Thus did Sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure, as
Don Quixote, who had the night before taken leave of the duke and
duchess, coming out made his appearance at an early hour in full
armour in the courtyard of the castle. The whole household of the
castle were watching him from the corridors, and the duke and duchess,
too, came out to see him. Sancho was mounted on his Dapple, with his
alforjas, valise, and proven, supremely happy because the duke's
majordomo, the same that had acted the part of the Trifaldi, had given
him a little purse with two hundred gold crowns to meet the necessary
expenses of the road, but of this Don Quixote knew nothing as yet.
While all were, as has been said, observing him, suddenly from among
the duennas and handmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidora lifted
up her voice and said in pathetic tones: Give ear, cruel knight; Draw
rein; where's the need Of spurring the flanks Of that ill-broken
steed? From what art thou flying? No dragon I am, Not even a sheep,
But a tender young lamb. Thou hast jilted a maiden As fair to behold
As nymph of Diana Or Venus of old. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I
call thee? Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! May no bowels
of mercy To Sancho be granted, And thy Dulcinea Be left still
enchanted, May thy falsehood to me Find its punishment in her, For in
my land the just Often pays for the sinner. May thy grandest
adventures Discomfitures prove, May thy joys be all dreams, And
forgotten thy love. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee?
Barabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee! In thy claws, ruthless
robber, Thou bearest away The heart of a meek Loving maid for thy
prey, Three kerchiefs thou stealest, And garters a pair, From legs
than the whitest Of marble more fair; And the sighs that pursue thee
Would burn to the ground Two thousand Troy Towns, If so many were
found. Bireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee? Barabbas go with
thee! All evil befall thee! All the while the unhappy Altisidora was
bewailing herself in the above strain Don Quixote stood staring at
her; and without uttering a word in reply to her he turned round to
Sancho and said, "Sancho my friend, I conjure thee by the life of thy
forefathers tell me the truth; say, hast thou by any chance taken the
three kerchiefs and the garters this love-sick maid speaks of?" To
this Sancho made answer, "The three kerchiefs I have; but the garters,
as much as 'over the hills of Ubeda.'" The duchess was amazed at
Altisidora's assurance; she knew that she was bold, lively, and
impudent, but not so much so as to justify the title of 'great' which
my father gives me." "I do not dislike that modesty," said Don
Quixote; "for there is no poet who is not conceited and does not think
he is the best poet in the world." "There is no rule without an
exception," said Don Lorenzo; "there may be some who are poets and yet
do not think they are." "Very few," said Don Quixote; "but tell me,
what verses are those which you have now in hand, and which your
father tells me keep you somewhat restless and absorbed? If it be some
gloss, I know something about glosses, and I should like to hear them;
and if they are for a poetical tournament, contrive to carry off the
second prize; for the first always goes by favour or personal
standing, the second by simple justice; and so the third comes to be
the second, and the first, reckoning in this way, will be third, in
the same way as licentiate degrees are conferred at the universities;
but, for all that, the title of first is a great distinction." "So
far," said Don Lorenzo to himself, "I should not take you to be a
madman; but let us go on." So he said to him, "Your worship has
apparently attended the schools; what sciences have you studied?"
"That of knight-errantry," said Don Quixote, "which is as good as that
of poetry, and even a finger or two above it." "I do not know what
science that is," said Don Lorenzo, "and until now I have never heard
of it." "It is a science," said Don Quixote, "that comprehends in
itself all or most of the sciences in the world, for he who professes
it must be a jurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive
and equitable, so as to give to each one what belongs to him and is
due to him. He must be a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear
and distinctive reason for the Christian faith he professes, wherever
it may be asked of him. He must be a physician, and above all a
herbalist, so as in wastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have
the property of healing wounds, for a knight-errant must not go
looking for some one to cure him at every step. He must be an
astronomer, so as to know by the stars how many hours of the night
have passed, and what clime and quarter of the world he is in. He must
know mathematics, for at every turn some occasion for them will
present itself to him; and, putting it aside that he must be adorned
with all the virtues, cardinal and theological, to come down to minor
particulars, he must, I say, be able to swim as well as Nicholas or
Nicolao the Fish could, as the story goes; he must know how to shoe a
horse, and repair his saddle and bridle; and, to return to higher
matters, he must be faithful to God and to his lady; he must be pure
in thought, decorous in words, generous in works, valiant in deeds,
patient in suffering, compassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an
upholder of the truth though its defence should cost him his life. Of
all these qualities, great and small, is a true knight-errant made up;
judge then, Senor Don Lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science
which the knight who studies and professes it has to learn, and
whether it may not compare with the very loftiest that are taught in
the schools." "If that be so," replied Don Lorenzo, "this science, I
protest, surpasses all." "How, if that be so?" said Don Quixote. "What
I mean to say," said Don Lorenzo, "is, that I doubt whether there are
now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with such virtues."
"Many a time," replied Don Quixote, "have I said what I now say once
more, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there never
were any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unless
heaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that there were
and are, all the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience has
often proved to me), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error
you share with the multitude. All I shall do is to pray to heaven to
deliver you from it, and show you how beneficial and necessary
knights-errant were in days of yore, and how useful they would be in
these days were they but in vogue; but now, for the sins of the
people, sloth and indolence, gluttony and luxury are triumphant." "Our
guest has broken out on our hands," said Don Lorenzo to himself at
this point; "but, for all that, he is a glorious madman, and I should
be a dull blockhead to doubt it." Here, being summoned to dinner, they
brought their colloquy to a close. Don Diego asked his son what he had
been able to make out as to the wits of their guest. To which he
replied, "All the doctors and clever scribes in the world will not
make sense of the scrawl of his madness; he is a madman full of
streaks, full of lucid intervals." They went in to dinner, and the
repast was such as Don Diego said on the road he was in the habit of
giving to his guests, neat, plentiful, and tasty; but what pleased Don
Quixote most was the marvellous silence that reigned throughout the
house, for it was like a Carthusian monastery. When the cloth had been
removed, grace said and their hands washed, Don Quixote earnestly
pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for the poetical
tournament, to which he replied, "Not to be like those poets who, when
they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when they are not
asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, for which I do
not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an exercise of
ingenuity." "A discerning friend of mine," said Don Quixote, "was of
opinion that no one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the
reason he gave was that the gloss can never come up to the text, and
that often or most frequently it wanders away from the meaning and
purpose aimed at in the glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of
the gloss were too strict, as they did not allow interrogations, nor
'said he,' nor 'I say,' nor turning verbs into nouns, or altering the
construction, not to speak of other restrictions and limitations that
fetter gloss-writers, as you no doubt know." "Verily, Senor Don
Quixote," said Don Lorenzo, "I wish I could catch your worship
tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slip through my fingers
like an eel." "I don't understand what you say, or mean by slipping,"
said Don Quixote. "I will explain myself another time," said Don
Lorenzo; "for the present pray attend to the glossed verses and the
gloss, which run thus: Could 'was' become an 'is' for me, Then would I
ask no more than this; Or could, for me, the time that is Become the
time that is to be!-- GLOSS Dame Fortune once upon a day To me was
bountiful and kind; But all things change; she changed her mind, And
what she gave she took away. O Fortune, long I've sued to thee; The
gifts thou gavest me restore, For, trust me, I would ask no more,
Could 'was' become an 'is' for me. No other prize I seek to gain, No
triumph, glory, or success, Only the long-lost happiness, The memory
whereof is pain. One taste, methinks, of bygone bliss The
heart-consuming fire might stay; And, so it come without delay, Then
would I ask no more than this; Or could, for me, the time that is
Become the time that is to be!-- GLOSS Dame Fortune once upon a day To
me was bountiful and kind; But all things change; she changed her
mind, And what she gave she took away. O Fortune, long I've sued to
thee; The gifts thou gavest me restore, For, trust me, I would ask no
more, Could 'was' become an 'is' for me. No other prize I seek to
gain, No triumph, glory, or success, Only the long-lost happiness, The
memory whereof is pain. One taste, methinks, of bygone bliss The
heart-consuming fire might stay; And, so it come without delay, Then
would I ask no more than this. I ask what cannot be, alas! That time
should ever be, and then Come back to us, and be again, No power on
earth can bring to pass; For fleet of foot is he, I wis, And idly,
therefore, do we pray That what for aye hath left us may Become for us
the time that is. Perplexed, uncertain, to remain 'Twixt hope and
fear, is death, not life; 'Twere better, sure, to end the strife, And
dying, seek release from pain. And yet, thought were the best for me.
Anon the thought aside I fling, And to the present fondly cling, And
dread the time that is to be." When Don Lorenzo had finished reciting
his gloss, Don Quixote stood up, and in a loud voice, almost a shout,
exclaimed as he grasped Don Lorenzo's right hand in his, "By the
highest heavens, noble youth, but you are the best poet on earth, and
deserve to be crowned with laurel, not by Cyprus or by Gaeta--as a
certain poet, God forgive him, said--but by the Academies of Athens,
if they still flourished, and by those that flourish now, Paris,
Bologna, Salamanca. Heaven grant that the judges who rob you of the
first prize--that Phoebus may pierce them with his arrows, and the
Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors. Repeat me some of
your long-measure verses, senor, if you will be so good, for I want
thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius." Is there any need
to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised by Don
Quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power of flattery, how
far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of thy pleasant
jurisdiction! Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he complied with Don
Quixote's request and entreaty, and repeated to him this sonnet on the
fable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe. SONNET The lovely maid, she
pierces now the wall; Heart-pierced by her young Pyramus doth lie; And
Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly, A chink to view so wondrous
great and small. There silence speaketh, for no voice at all Can pass
so strait a strait; but love will ply Where to all other power 'twere
vain to try; For love will find a way whate'er befall. Impatient of
delay, with reckless pace The rash maid wins the fatal spot where she
Sinks not in lover's arms but death's embrace. So runs the strange
tale, how the lovers twain One sword, one sepulchre, one memory,
Slays, and entombs, and brings to life again. "Blessed be God," said
Don Quixote when he had heard Don Lorenzo's sonnet, "that among the
hosts there are of irritable poets I have found one consummate one,
which, senor, the art of this sonnet proves to me that you are!" For
four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously entertained in Don Diego's
house, at the end of which time he asked his permission to depart,
telling him he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality he had
received in his house, but that, as it did not become knights-errant
to give themselves up for long to idleness and luxury, he was anxious
to fulfill the duties of his calling in seeking adventures, of which
he was informed there was an abundance in that neighbourhood, where he
hoped to employ his time until the day came round for the jousts at
Saragossa, for that was his proper destination; and that, first of
all, he meant to enter the cave of Montesinos, of which so many
marvellous things were reported all through the country, and at the
same time to investigate and explore the origin and true source of the
seven lakes commonly called the lakes of Ruidera. Don Diego and his
son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him furnish himself
with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as they would most
gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personal worth and his
honourable profession made incumbent upon them. The day of his
departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as it was sad and
sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied with the
abundance of Don Diego's house, and objected to return to the
starvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his
ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what
he considered needful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don
Lorenzo, "I know not whether I have told you already, but if I have I
tell you once more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and
toil in reaching the inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you
have nothing to do but to let yourselves be guided by what he says,
and on my head be it if it is wrong. Besides which, you have been told
that it is folly to take offence at merely hearing a bray. I remember
when I was a boy I brayed as often as I had a fancy, without anyone
hindering me, and so elegantly and naturally that when I brayed all
the asses in the town would bray; but I was none the less for that the
son of my parents who were greatly respected; and though I was envied
because of the gift by more than one of the high and mighty ones of
the town, I did not care two farthings for it; and that you may see I
am telling the truth, wait a bit and listen, for this art, like
swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;" and then, taking hold of
his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that all the valleys around
rang again. One of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he
was mocking them, lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote
him such a blow with it that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground.
Don Quixote, seeing him so roughly handled, attacked the man who had
struck him lance in hand, but so many thrust themselves between them
that he could not avenge him. Far from it, finding a shower of stones
rained upon him, and crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled at him,
he wheeled Rocinante round and, as fast as his best gallop could take
him, fled from the midst of them, commending himself to God with all
his heart to deliver him out of this peril, in dread every step of
some ball coming in at his back and coming out at his breast, and
every minute drawing his breath to see whether it had gone from him.
The members of the band, however, were satisfied with seeing him take
to flight, and did not fire on him. They put up Sancho, scarcely
restored to his senses, on his ass, and let him go after his master;
not that he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast, but
Dapple followed the footsteps of Rocinante, from whom he could not
remain a moment separated. Don Quixote having got some way off looked
back, and seeing Sancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that
no one followed him. The men of the troop stood their ground till
night, and as the enemy did not come out to battle, they returned to
their town exulting; and had they been aware of the ancient custom of
the Greeks, they would have erected a trophy on the spot. CHAPTER
XXVIII. OF MATTERS THAT BENENGELI SAYS HE WHO READS THEM WILL KNOW, IF
HE READS THEM WITH ATTENTION When the brave man flees, treachery is
manifest and it is for wise men to reserve themselves for better
occasions. This proved to be the case with Don Quixote, who, giving
way before the fury of the townsfolk and the hostile intentions of the
angry troop, took to flight and, without a thought of Sancho or the
danger in which he was leaving him, retreated to such a distance as he
thought made him safe. Sancho, lying across his ass, followed him, as
has been said, and at length came up, having by this time recovered
his senses, and on joining him let himself drop off Dapple at
Rocinante's feet, sore, bruised, and belaboured. Don Quixote
dismounted to examine his wounds, but finding him whole from head to
foot, he said to him, angrily enough, "In an evil hour didst thou take
to braying, Sancho! Where hast thou learned that it is well done to
mention the rope in the house of the man that has been hanged? To the
music of brays what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels?
Give thanks to God, Sancho, that they signed the cross on thee just
now with a stick, and did not mark thee per signum crucis with a
cutlass." "I'm not equal to answering," said Sancho, "for I feel as if
I was speaking through my shoulders; let us mount and get away from
this; I'll keep from braying, but not from saying that knights-errant
fly and leave their good squires to be pounded like privet, or made
meal of at the hands of their enemies." "He does not fly who retires,"
returned Don Quixote; "for I would have thee know, Sancho, that the
famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knights-errant--I am
wrong to say he was one; he stood alone, the first, the only one, the
lord of all that were in the world in his time. A fig for Don
Belianis, and for all who say he equalled him in any respect, for, my
oath upon it, they are deceiving themselves! I say, too, that when a
painter desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the
originals of the rarest painters that he knows; and the same rule
holds good for all the most important crafts and callings that serve
to adorn a state; thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and
patient imitate Ulysses, in whose person and labours Homer presents to
us a lively picture of prudence and patience; as Virgil, too, shows us
in the person of AEneas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of
a brave and skilful captain; not representing or describing them as
they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has to
write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were,
without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it."
"Well then," said Sancho, "if this senor Moor goes in for telling the
truth, no doubt among my master's drubbings mine are to be found; for
they never took the measure of his worship's shoulders without doing
the same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that,
for, as my master himself says, the members must share the pain of the
head." "You are a sly dog, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "i' faith, you
have no want of memory when you choose to remember." "If I were to try
to forget the thwacks they gave me," said Sancho, "my weals would not
let me, for they are still fresh on my ribs." "Hush, Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "and don't interrupt the bachelor, whom I entreat to go on
and tell all that is said about me in this history." "And about me,"
said Sancho, "for they say, too, that I am one of the principal
presonages in it." "Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho," said
Samson. "What! Another word-catcher!" said Sancho; "if that's to be
the way we shall not make an end in a lifetime." "May God shorten
mine, Sancho," returned the bachelor, "if you are not the second
person in the history, and there are even some who would rather hear
you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though there are some,
too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing there was
any possibility in the government of that island offered you by Senor
Don Quixote." "There is still sunshine on the wall," said Don Quixote;
"and when Sancho is somewhat more advanced in life, with the
experience that years bring, he will be fitter and better qualified
for being a governor than he is at present." "By God, master," said
Sancho, "the island that I cannot govern with the years I have, I'll
not be able to govern with the years of Methuselah; the difficulty is
that the said island keeps its distance somewhere, I know not where;
and not that there is any want of head in me to govern it." "Leave it
to God, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "for all will be and perhaps better
than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs but by God's will." "That is
true," said Samson; "and if it be God's will, there will not be any
want of a thousand islands, much less one, for Sancho to govern." "I
have seen governors in these parts," said Sancho, "that are not to be
compared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called 'your
lordship' and served on silver." "Those are not governors of islands,"
observed Samson, "but of other governments of an easier kind: those
that govern islands must at least know grammar." "I could manage the
gram well enough," said Sancho; "but for the mar I have neither
leaning nor liking, for I don't know what it is; but leaving this
matter of the government in God's hands, to send me wherever it may be
most to his service, I may tell you, senor bachelor Samson Carrasco,
it has pleased me beyond measure that the author of this history
should have spoken of me in such a way that what is said of me gives
no offence; for, on the faith of a true squire, if he had said
anything about me that was at all unbecoming an old Christian, such as
I am, the deaf would have heard of it." "That would be working
miracles," said Samson. "Miracles or no miracles," said Sancho, "let
everyone mind how he speaks or writes about people, and not set down
at random the first thing that comes into his head." "One of the
faults they find with this history," said the bachelor, "is that its
author inserted in it a novel called 'The Ill-advised Curiosity;' not
that it is bad or ill-told, but that it is out of place and has
nothing to do with the history of his worship Senor Don Quixote." "I
will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,"
said Sancho. "Then, I say," said Don Quixote, "the author of my
history was no sage, but some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard
and heedless way, set about writing it, let it turn out as it might,
just as Orbaneja, the painter of Ubeda, used to do, who, when they
asked him what he was painting, used to say, 'Whatever it may turn
out; and if he chanced to paint a cock he would write under it, 'This
is a cock,' for fear they might think it was a fox. The painter or
writer, for it's all the same, who published the history of this new
Don Quixote that has come out, must have been one of this sort I
think, Sancho, for he painted or wrote 'whatever it might turn out;'
or perhaps he is like a poet called Mauleon that was about the Court
some years ago, who used to answer at haphazard whatever he was asked,
and on one asking him what Deum de Deo meant, he replied De donde
diere. But, putting this aside, tell me, Sancho, hast thou a mind to
have another turn at thyself to-night, and wouldst thou rather have it
indoors or in the open air?" "Egad, senor," said Sancho, "for what I'm
going to give myself, it comes all the same to me whether it is in a
house or in the fields; still I'd like it to be among trees; for I
think they are company for me and help me to bear my pain
wonderfully." "And yet it must not be, Sancho my friend," said Don
Quixote; "but, to enable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for
our own village; for at the latest we shall get there the day after
tomorrow." Sancho said he might do as he pleased; but that for his own
part he would like to finish off the business quickly before his blood
cooled and while he had an appetite, because "in delay there is apt to
be danger" very often, and "praying to God and plying the hammer," and
"one take was better than two I'll give thee's," and "a sparrow in the
hand than a vulture on the wing." "For God's sake, Sancho, no more
proverbs!" exclaimed Don Quixote; "it seems to me thou art becoming
sicut erat again; speak in a plain, simple, straight-forward way, as I
have often told thee, and thou wilt find the good of it." "I don't
know what bad luck it is of mine," argument to my mind; however, I
mean to mend if I can;" and so for the present the conversation ended.
CHAPTER LXXII. OF HOW DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO REACHED THEIR VILLAGE All
that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and inn
waiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the
open country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the
accomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry
a traveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said
to him who appeared to be the master, "Here, Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe,
your worship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and
cool." When he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, "Look here,
Sancho; on turning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of
my history I think I came casually upon this name of Don Alvaro
Tarfe." "Very likely," said Sancho; "we had better let him dismount,
and by-and-by we can ask about it." The gentleman dismounted, and the
landlady gave him a room on the ground floor opposite Don Quixote's
and adorned with painted serge hangings of the same sort. The newly
arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and coming out to the gateway
of the hostelry, which was wide and cool, addressing Don Quixote, who
was pacing up and down there, he asked, "In what direction your
worship bound, gentle sir?" "To a village near this which is my own
village," replied Don Quixote; "and your worship, where are you bound
for?" "I am going to Granada, senor," said the gentleman, "to my own
country." "And a goodly country," said Don Quixote; "but will your
worship do me the favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it
is of more importance to me to know it than I can tell you." "My name
is Don Alvaro Tarfe," replied the traveller. To which Don Quixote
returned, "I have no doubt whatever that your worship is that Don
Alvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Part of the history of
Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and published by a new
author." "I am the same," replied the gentleman; "and that same Don
Quixote, the principal personage in the said history, was a very great
friend of mine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at least
induced him to come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa,
whither I was going myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and
saved him from having his shoulders touched up by the executioner
because of his extreme rashness." "Tell me, Senor Don Alvaro," said
Don Quixote, "am I at all like that Don Quixote you talk of?" "No
indeed," replied the traveller, "not a bit." "And that Don Quixote-"
said our one, "had he with him a squire called Sancho Panza?" "He
had," said Don Alvaro; "but though he had the name of being very
droll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it."
"That I can well believe," said Sancho at this, "for to come out with
drolleries is not in everybody's line; and that Sancho your worship
speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, and
thief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I have more
drolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try; come
along with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me at
every turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don't
know what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh. And the
real Don Quixote of La Mancha, cynosure and morning star of
knight-errantry, despite and in defiance of him who has sought to
usurp your name and bring to naught your achievements, as the author
of this book which I here present to you has done;" and with this he
put a book which his companion carried into the hands of Don Quixote,
who took it, and without replying began to run his eye over it; but he
presently returned it saying, "In the little I have seen I have
discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured.
The first is some words that I have read in the preface; the next that
the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he writes without articles;
and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that he goes
wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of the
history, for here he says that my squire Sancho Panza's wife is called
Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but Teresa
Panza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is
good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the
history." "A nice sort of historian, indeed!" exclaimed Sancho at
this; "he must know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife
Teresa Panza, Mari Gutierrez; take the book again, senor, and see if I
am in it and if he has changed my name." "From your talk, friend,"
said Don Jeronimo, "no doubt you are Sancho Panza, Senor Don Quixote's
squire." "Yes, I am," said Sancho; "and I'm proud of it." "Faith,
then," said the gentleman, "this new author does not handle you with
the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out a
heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very
different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your
master's history." "God forgive him," said Sancho; "he might have left
me in my corner without troubling his head about me; 'let him who
knows how ring the bells; 'Saint Peter is very well in Rome.'" The two
gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have supper
with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn fit
for one of his sort. Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded to
their request and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the
stew. and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at
the head of the table, for there was only that seat placed, and no
more than one cover laid. A personage, who it appeared afterwards was
a physician, placed himself standing by his side with a whalebone wand
in his hand. They then lifted up a fine white cloth covering fruit and
a great variety of dishes of different sorts; one who looked like a
student said grace, and a page put a laced bib on Sancho, while
another who played the part of head carver placed a dish of fruit
before him. But hardly had he tasted a morsel when the man with the
wand touched the plate with it, and they took it away from before him
with the utmost celerity. The carver, however, brought him another
dish, and Sancho proceeded to try it; but before he could get at it,
not to say taste it, already the wand had touched it and a page had
carried it off with the same promptitude as the fruit. Sancho seeing
this was puzzled, and looking from one to another asked if this dinner
was to be eaten after the fashion of a jugglery trick. To this he with
the wand replied, "It is not to be eaten, senor governor, except as is
usual and customary in other islands where there are governors. I,
senor, am a physician, and I am paid a salary in this island to serve
its governors as such, and I have a much greater regard for their
health than for my own, studying day and night and making myself
acquainted with the governor's constitution, in order to be able to
cure him when he falls sick. The chief thing I have to do is to attend
at his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to me to
be fit for him, and keep from him what I think will do him harm and be
injurious to his stomach; and therefore I ordered that plate of fruit
to be removed as being too moist, and that other dish I ordered to be
removed as being too hot and containing many spices that stimulate
thirst; for he who drinks much kills and consumes the radical moisture
wherein life consists." "Well then," said Sancho, "that dish of roast
partridges there that seems so savoury will not do me any harm." To
this the physician replied, "Of those my lord the governor shall not
eat so long as I live." "Why so?" said Sancho. "Because," replied the
doctor, "our master Hippocrates, the polestar and beacon of medicine,
says in one of his aphorisms omnis saturatio mala, perdicis autem
pessima, which means 'all repletion is bad, but that of partridge is
the worst of all." "In that case," said Sancho, "let senor doctor see
among the dishes that are on the table what will do me most good and
least harm, and let me eat it, without tapping it with his stick; for
by the life of the governor, and so may God suffer me to enjoy it, but
I'm dying of hunger; and in spite of the doctor and all he may say, to
deny me food is the way to take my life instead of prolonging it."
"Your worship is right, senor governor," said the physician; "and
therefore your worship, I consider, should not eat of those stewed
rabbits there, because it is a furry kind of food; if that veal were
not roasted and served with pickles, you might try it; but it is out
of the question." "That big dish that is smoking farther off," said
Sancho, "seems to me to be an olla podrida, and out of the diversity
of things in such ollas, I can't fail to light upon something tasty
and good for me." "Absit," said the doctor; "far from us be any such
base thought! There is nothing in the world less nourishing than an
olla podrida; to canons, or rectors of colleges, or peasants' weddings
with your ollas podridas, but let us have none of them on the tables
of governors, where everything that is present should be delicate and
refined; and the reason is, that always, everywhere and by everybody,
simple medicines are more esteemed than compound ones, for we cannot
go wrong in those that are simple, while in the compound we may, by
merely altering the quantity of the things composing them. But what I
am of opinion the governor should cat now in order to preserve and
fortify his health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a few thin
slices of conserve of quinces, which will settle his stomach and help
his digestion." Sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair
and surveyed the doctor steadily, and in a solemn tone asked him what
his name was and where he had studied. He replied, "My name, senor
governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio de Aguero I am a native of a place
called Tirteafuera which lies between Caracuel and Almodovar del
Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have the degree of doctor from
the university of Osuna." To which Sancho, glowing all over with rage,
returned, "Then let Doctor Pedro Recio de Malaguero, native of
Tirteafuera, a place that's on the right-hand side as we go from
Caracuel to Almodovar del Campo, graduate of Osuna, get out of my
presence at once; or I swear by the sun I'll take a cudgel, and by
dint of blows, beginning with him, I'll not leave a doctor in the
whole island; at least of those I know to be ignorant; for as to
learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will reverence and honour
as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recio get out of this or
I'll take this chair I am sitting on and break it over his head. And
if they call me to account for it, I'll clear myself by saying I
served God in killing a bad doctor--a general executioner. And now
give me something to eat, or else take your government; for a trade
that does not feed its master is not worth two beans." The doctor was
dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion, and he would have
made a Tirteafuera out of the room but that the same instant a
post-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting his head out
of the window turned round and said, "It's a courier from my lord the
duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance." The courier came in
all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper from his bosom, placed
it in the governor's hands. Sancho handed it to the majordomo and bade
him read the superscription, which ran thus: To Don Sancho Panza,
Governor of the Island of Barataria, into his own hands or those of
his secretary. Sancho when he heard this said, "Which of you is my
secretary?" "I am, senor," said one of those present, "for I can read
and write, and am a Biscayan." "With that addition," said Sancho, "you
might be secretary to the emperor himself; open this paper and see
what it says." The new-born secretary obeyed, and having read the
contents said the matter was one to be discussed in private. Sancho
ordered the chamber to be cleared, the majordomo and the carver only
remaining; so the doctor and the others withdrew, and then the
secretary read the letter, which was as follows: It has come to my
knowledge, Senor Don Sancho Panza, that certain enemies of mine and of
the island are about to make a furious attack upon it some night, I
know not when. It behoves you to be on the alert and keep watch, that
they surprise you not. I also know by trustworthy spies that four
persons have entered the town in disguise in order to take your life,
because they stand in dread of your great capacity; keep your eyes
open and take heed who approaches you to address you, and eat nothing
that is presented to you. I will take care to send you aid if you find
yourself in difficulty, but in all things you will act as may be
expected of your judgment. From this place, the Sixteenth of August,
at four in the morning. Your friend, THE DUKE Sancho was astonished,
and those who stood by made believe to be so too, and turning to the
majordomo he said to him, "What we have got to do first, and it must
be done at once, is to put Doctor Recio in the lock-up; for if anyone
wants to kill me it is he, and by a slow death and the worst of all,
which is hunger." "Likewise," said the carver, "it is my opinion your
worship should not eat anything that is on this table, for the whole
was a present from some nuns; and as they say, 'behind the cross
there's the devil; to the fire with it." Taking down another book, the
barber said, "This is 'The Mirror of Chivalry.'" "I know his worship,"
said the curate; "that is where Senor Reinaldos of Montalvan figures
with his friends and comrades, greater thieves than Cacus, and the
Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian Turpin; however, I
am not for condemning them to more than perpetual banishment, because,
at any rate, they have some share in the invention of the famous
Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico Ariosto wove
his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any language but
his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks his own
tongue I will put him upon my head." "Well, I have him in Italian,"
said the barber, "but I do not understand him." "Nor would it be well
that you should understand him," said the curate, "and on that score
we might have excused the Captain if he had not brought him into Spain
and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of a great deal of his
natural force, and so do all those who try to turn books written in
verse into another language, for, with all the pains they take and all
the cleverness they show, they never can reach the level of the
originals as they were first produced. In short, I say that this book,
and all that may be found treating of those French affairs, should be
thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until after more
consideration it is settled what is to be done with them; excepting
always one 'Bernardo del Carpio' that is going about, and another
called 'Roncesvalles;' for these, if they come into my hands, shall
pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into the
fire without any reprieve." To all this the barber gave his assent,
and looked upon it as right and proper, being persuaded that the
curate was so staunch to the Faith and loyal to the Truth that he
would not for the world say anything opposed to them. Opening another
book he saw it was "Palmerin de Oliva," and beside it was another
called "Palmerin of England," seeing which the licentiate said, "Let
the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no ashes even
are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and preserved as a
thing that stands alone, and let such another case be made for it as
that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set aside
for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This book,
gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very
good, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise
and witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of
Miraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the
language is polished and clear, studying and observing the style
befitting the speaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided
it seems good to you, Master Nicholas, I say let this and 'Amadis of
Gaul' be remitted the penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let
them perish without further question or query." "Nay, gossip," said
the barber, "for this that I have here is the famous 'Don Belianis.'"
"Well," said the curate, "that and the second, third, and fourth parts
all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile,
and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame
and other greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the
over-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice
be meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them
in your house and let no one read them." "With all my heart," said the
barber; and not caring to tire himself with reading more books of
chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take all the big ones and throw
them into the yard. It was not said to one dull or deaf, but to one
who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest and finest web
that could be; and seizing about eight at a time, she flung them out
of the window. In carrying so many together she let one fall at the
feet of the barber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and
found it said, "History of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco." "God
bless me!" said the curate with a shout, "'Tirante el Blanco' here!
Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury of
enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of
Montalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and
the knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the
mastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the
loves and wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with
the squire Hipolito--in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the
best book in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their
beds, and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of
which there is nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he
who wrote it, for deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to
be sent to the galleys for life. Take it home with you and read it,
and you will see that what I have said is true." "As you will," said
the barber; "but what are we to do with these little books that are
left?" "These must be, not chivalry, but poetry," said the curate; and
opening one he saw it was the "Diana" of Jorge de Montemayor, and,
supposing all the others to be of the same sort, "these," he said, "do
not deserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can
do the mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of
entertainment that can hurt no one." "Ah, senor!" said the niece,
"your worship had better order these to be burned as well as the
others; for it would be no wonder if, after being cured of his
chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancy to turn
shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or, what
would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is an incurable and
infectious malady." "The damsel is right," said the curate, "and it
will be well to put this stumbling-block and temptation out of our
friend's way. To begin, then, with the 'Diana' of Montemayor. I am of
opinion it should not be burned, but that it should be cleared of all
that about the sage Felicia and the magic water, and of almost all the
longer pieces of verse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the
honour of being the first of books of the kind." "This that comes
next," said the barber, "is the 'Diana,' entitled the 'Second Part, by
the Salamancan,' and this other has the same title, and its author is
Gil Polo." "As for that of the Salamancan," replied the curate, "let
it go to swell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil
Polo's be preserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on,
gossip, and make haste, for it is growing late." "This book," said the
barber, opening another, "is the ten books of the 'Fortune of Love,'
written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet." "By the orders I
have received," said the curate, "since Apollo has been Apollo, and
the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets, so droll and
absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it is the
best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet
appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read
what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of
having found it than if they had given me a cassock of Florence
stuff." He put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went
on, "These that come next are 'The Shepherd of Iberia,' 'Nymphs of
Henares,' and 'The Enlightenment of Jealousy.'" "Then all we have to
do," said the curate, "is to hand them over to the secular arm of the
housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never have done." "This
next is the 'Pastor de Filida.'" "No Pastor that," said the curate,
"but a highly polished courtier; let it be preserved as a precious
jewel." "This large one here," said the barber, "is called 'The
Treasury of various Poems.'" "If there were not so many of them," said
the curate, "they would be more relished: this book must be weeded and
cleansed of certain vulgarities which it has with its excellences; let
it be preserved because the author is a friend of mine, and out of
respect for other more heroic and loftier works that he has written."
"This," continued the barber, "is the 'Cancionero' of Lopez de
Maldonado." "The author of that book, too," said the curate, "is a
great friend of mine, and his verses from his own mouth are the
admiration of all who hear them, for such is the sweetness of his
voice that he enchants when he chants them: it gives rather too much
of its eclogues, but what is good was never yet plentiful: let it be
kept with those that have been set apart. But what book is that next
it?" "The 'Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes," said the barber. "That
Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my
knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His
book has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but
brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it
promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full
measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you,
senor gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters." "Very good," said
the barber; "and here come three together, the 'Araucana' of Don
Alonso de Ercilla, the 'Austriada' of Juan Rufo, Justice of Cordova,
and the 'Montserrate' of Christobal de Virues, the Valencian poet."
"These three books," said the curate, "are the best that have been
written in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the
most famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures
of poetry that Spain possesses." The curate was tired and would not
look into any more books, and so he decided that, "contents
uncertified," all the rest should be burned; but just then the barber
held open one, called "The Tears of Angelica." "I should have shed
tears myself," said the curate when he heard the title, "had I ordered
that book to be burned, for its author was one of the famous poets of
the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy in the translation
of some of Ovid's fables." CHAPTER VII. OF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR
WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA At this instant Don Quixote
began shouting out, "Here, here, valiant knights! here is need for you
to put forth the might of your strong arms, for they of the Court are
gaining the mastery in the tourney!" Called away by this noise and
outcry, they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny of the remaining
books, and so it is thought that "The Carolea," "The Lion of Spain,"
and "The Deeds of the Emperor," written by Don Luis de Avila, went to
the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt they were among those that
remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them they would not have
undergone so severe a sentence. When they reached Don Quixote he was
already out of bed, and was still shouting and raving, and slashing
and cutting all round, as wide awake as if he had never slept. They
closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had
become a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, "Of a
truth, Senor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call
ourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the
Court to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having
carried off the honour on the three former days." "Hush, gossip," said
the curate; "please God, the luck may turn, and what is lost to-day
may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship have a care of
your health, for it seems to me that you are over-fatigued, if not
badly wounded." "Wounded no," said Don Quixote, "but bruised and
battered no doubt, for that bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with
the trunk of an oak tree, and all for envy, because he sees that I
alone rival him in his achievements. But I should not call myself
Reinaldos of Montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all his
enchantments as soon as I rise from this bed. For the present let them
bring me something to eat, for that, I feel, is what will be more to
my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge myself." They did as he
wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he fell asleep,
leaving them marvelling at his madness. That night the housekeeper
burned to ashes all the books that were in the yard and in the whole
house; and some must have been consumed that deserved preservation in
everlasting archives, but their fate and the laziness of the examiner
did not permit it, and so in them was verified the proverb that the
innocent suffer for the guilty. One of the remedies which the curate
and the barber immediately applied to their friend's disorder was to
wall up and plaster the room where the books were, so that when he got
up he should not find them (possibly the cause being removed the
effect might cease), and they might say that a magician had carried
them off, room and all; and this was done with all despatch. Two days
later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he did was to exhibit
his show, sometimes one story, sometimes another, but all lively,
amusing, and familiar. As soon as the exhibition was over he brought
forward the accomplishments of his ape, assuring the public that he
divined all the past and the present, but as to the future he had no
skill. For each question answered he asked two reals, and for some he
made a reduction, just as he happened to feel the pulse of the
questioners; and when now and then he came to houses where things that
he knew of had happened to the people living there, even if they did
not ask him a question, not caring to pay for it, he would make the
sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so, which
fitted the case exactly. In this way he acquired a prodigious name and
all ran after him; on other occasions, being very crafty, he would
answer in such a way that the answers suited the questions; and as no
one cross-questioned him or pressed him to tell how his ape divined,
he made fools of them all and filled his pouch. The instant he entered
the inn he knew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with that knowledge it was
easy for him to astonish them and all who were there; but it would
have cost him dear had Don Quixote brought down his hand a little
lower when he cut off King Marsilio's head and destroyed all his
horsemen, as related in the preceeding chapter. So much for Master
Pedro and his ape; and now to return to Don Quixote of La Mancha.
After he had left the inn he determined to visit, first of all, the
banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before entering the city of
Saragossa, for the ample time there was still to spare before the
jousts left him enough for all. With this object in view he followed
the road and travelled along it for two days, without meeting any
adventure worth committing to writing until on the third day, as he
was ascending a hill, he heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, and
musket-shots. At first he imagined some regiment of soldiers was
passing that way, and to see them he spurred Rocinante and mounted the
hill. On reaching the top he saw at the foot of it over two hundred
men, as it seemed to him, armed with weapons of various sorts, lances,
crossbows, partisans, halberds, and pikes, and a few muskets and a
great many bucklers. He descended the slope and approached the band
near enough to see distinctly the flags, make out the colours and
distinguish the devices they bore, especially one on a standard or
ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a very life-like
style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouth open and
its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying; and
round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines-- They did
not bray in vain, Our alcaldes twain. From this device Don Quixote
concluded that these people must be from the braying town, and he said
so to Sancho, explaining to him what was written on the standard. At
the same time he observed that the man who had told them about the
matter was wrong in saying that the two who brayed were regidors, for
according to the lines of the standard they were alcaldes. To which
Sancho replied, "Senor, there's nothing to stick at in that, for maybe
the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes of their town
afterwards, and so they may go by both titles; moreover, it has
nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were
alcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray; for an
alcalde is just as likely to bray as a regidor." They perceived, in
short, clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to
do battle with some other that had jeered it more than was fair or
neighbourly. Don Quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to
Sancho's uneasiness, for he never relished mixing himself up in
expeditions of that sort. The members of the troop received him into
the midst of them, taking him to be some one who was on their side.
Don Quixote, putting up his visor, advanced with an easy bearing and
demeanour to the standard with the ass, and all the chief men of the
army gathered round him to look at him, staring at him with the usual
amazement that everybody felt on seeing him for the first time. Don
Quixote, seeing them examining him so attentively, and that none of
them spoke to him or put any question to him, determined to take
advantage of their silence; so, breaking his own, he lifted up his
voice and said, "Worthy sirs, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in
the name of all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name,
country, rank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herself
fortunate if all the world knows that she is loved and served by such
a knight as your worship seems to be." At this Don Quixote heaved a
deep sigh and said, "I cannot say positively whether my sweet enemy is
pleased or not that the world should know I serve her; I can only say
in answer to what has been so courteously asked of me, that her name
is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank
must be at least that of a princess, since she is my queen and lady,
and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and fanciful
attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are
verified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields,
her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips
coral, her teeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her
hands ivory, her fairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight
such, I think and imagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not
compare." "We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,"
said Vivaldo. To which Don Quixote replied, "She is not of the ancient
Roman Curtii, Caii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini,
nor of the Moncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the
Rebellas or Villanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis,
Corellas, Lunas, Alagones, Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon;
Cerdas, Manriques, Mendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros,
Pallas, or Meneses of Portugal; but she is of those of El Toboso of La
Mancha, a lineage that though modern, may furnish a source of gentle
blood for the most illustrious families of the ages that are to come,
and this let none dispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino
placed at the foot of the trophy of Orlando's arms, saying, 'These let
none move Who dareth not his might with Roland prove." "That's the
very thing," said Sancho; "and if it was not that we should feel the
want of Rocinante on the road, it would be as well to leave him hung
up too." "And yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung
up," said Don Quixote, "that it may not be said, 'for good service a
bad return.'" "Your worship is right," said Sancho; "for, as sensible
people hold, 'the fault of the ass must not be laid on the
pack-saddle;' and, as in this affair the fault is your worship's,
punish yourself and don't let your anger break out against the already
battered and bloody armour, or the meekness of Rocinante, or the
tenderness of my feet, trying to make them travel more than is
reasonable." In converse of this sort the whole of that day went by,
as did the four succeeding ones, without anything occurring to
interrupt their journey, but on the fifth as they entered a village
they found a great number of people at the door of an inn enjoying
themselves, as it was a holiday. Upon Don Quixote's approach a peasant
called out, "One of these two gentlemen who come here, and who don't
know the parties, will tell us what we ought to do about our wager."
"That I will, certainly," said Don Quixote, "and according to the
rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it." "Well, here it
is, worthy sir," said the peasant; "a man of this village who is so
fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a neighbour of
his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. The agreement
was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with equal
weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were to be
equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone, should put
eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty stone of
the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one." "Not at
all," exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could answer; "it's
for me, that only a few days ago left off being a governor and a
judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful questions and
give an opinion in disputes of all sorts." "Answer in God's name,
Sancho my friend," said Don Quixote, "for I am not fit to give crumbs
to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset." With this permission
Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered round him, waiting
with open mouths for the decision to come from his, "Brothers, what
the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a shadow of justice
in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the challenged may
choose the weapons, the other has no right to choose such as will
prevent and keep him from winning. My decision, therefore, is that the
fat challenger prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and take
eleven stone of his flesh off his body, here or there, as he pleases,
and as suits him best; and being in this way reduced to nine stone
weight, he will make himself equal and even with nine stone of his
opponent, and they will be able to run on equal terms." "By all that's
good," said one of the peasants as he heard Sancho's decision, "but
the gentleman has spoken like a saint, and given judgment like a
canon! But I'll be bound the fat man won't part with an ounce of his
flesh, not to say eleven stone." "The best plan will be for them not
to run," said another, "so that neither the thin man break down under
the weight, nor the fat one strip himself of his flesh; let half the
wager be spent in wine, and let's take these gentlemen to the tavern
where there's the best, and 'over me be the cloak when it rains." "I
thank you, sirs," said Don Quixote; "but I cannot stop for an instant,
for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem
discourteous and to travel apace;" and spurring Rocinante he pushed
on, leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his own
strange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they
took Sancho to be; and another of them observed, "If the servant is so
clever, what must the master be? I'll bet, if they are going to
Salamanca to study, they'll come to be alcaldes of the Court in a
trice; for it's a mere joke--only to read and read, and have interest
and good luck; and before a man knows where he is he finds himself
with a staff in his hand or a mitre on his head." That night master
and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and the next day as
they were pursuing their journey they saw coming towards them a man on
foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked staff in his
hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he came close to
Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running came up to him, and
embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no higher, exclaimed
with evident pleasure, "O Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what
happiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows
your worship is coming back to his castle, for he is still there with
my lady the duchess!" "I do not recognise you, friend," said Don
Quixote, "nor do I know who you are, unless you tell me." "I am
Tosilos, my lord the duke's lacquey, Senor Don Quixote," replied the
courier; "he who refused to fight your worship about marrying the
daughter of Dona Rodriguez." "God bless me!" exclaimed Don Quixote;
"is it possible that you are the one whom mine enemies the enchanters
changed into the lacquey you speak of in order to rob me of the honour
of that battle?" "Nonsense, good sir!" said the messenger; "there was
no enchantment or transformation at all; I entered the lists just as
much lacquey Tosilos as I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought
to marry without fighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my
scheme had a very different result, for as soon as your worship had
left the castle my lord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick
given me for having acted contrary to the orders he gave me before
engaging in the combat; and the end of the whole affair is that the
girl has become a nun, and Dona Rodriguez has gone back to Castile,
and I am now on my way to Barcelona with a packet of letters for the
viceroy which my master is sending him. If your worship would like a
drop, sound though warm, I have a gourd here full of the best, and
some scraps of Tronchon cheese that will serve as a provocative and
wakener of your thirst if so be it is asleep." "I take the offer,"
said Sancho; "no more compliments about it; pour out, good Tosilos, in
spite of all the enchanters in the Indies." "Thou art indeed the
greatest glutton in the world, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and the
greatest booby on earth, not to be able to see that this courier is
enchanted and this Tosilos a sham one; stop with him and take thy
fill; I will go on slowly and wait for thee to come up with me." The
lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and
taking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on
the green grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the
contents of the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they
licked the wrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese.
Said Tosilos to Sancho, "Beyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this master
of thine ought to be a madman." "Ought!" said Sancho; "he owes no man
anything; he pays for everything, particularly when the coin is
madness. I see it plain enough, and I tell him so plain enough; but
what's the use? especially now that it is all over with him, for here
he is beaten by the Knight of the White Moon." Tosilos begged him to
explain what had happened him, but Sancho replied that it would not be
good manners to leave his master waiting for him; and that some other
day if they met there would be time enough for that; and then getting
up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the crumbs out of his
beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and bidding adieu to Tosilos
left him and rejoined his master, who was waiting for him under the
shade of a tree. CHAPTER LXVII. OF THE RESOLUTION DON QUIXOTE FORMED
TO TURN SHEPHERD AND TAKE TO A LIFE IN THE FIELDS WHILE THE YEAR FOR
WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIS WORD WAS RUNNING ITS COURSE; WITH OTHER EVENTS
TRULY DELECTABLE AND HAPPY CHAPTER LXVIII OF THE BRISTLY ADVENTURE
THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE The night was somewhat dark, for though there
was a moon in the sky it was not in a quarter where she could be seen;
for sometimes the lady Diana goes on a stroll to the antipodes, and
leaves the mountains all black and the valleys in darkness. Don
Quixote obeyed nature so far as to sleep his first sleep, but did not
give way to the second, very different from Sancho, who never had any
second, because with him sleep lasted from night till morning, wherein
he showed what a sound constitution and few cares he had. Don
Quixote's cares kept him restless, so much so that he awoke Sancho and
said to him, "I am amazed, Sancho, at the unconcern of thy
temperament. I believe thou art made of marble or hard brass,
incapable of any emotion or feeling whatever. I lie awake while thou
sleepest, I weep while thou singest, I am faint with fasting while
thou art sluggish and torpid from pure repletion. It is the duty of
good servants to share the sufferings and feel the sorrows of their
masters, if it be only for the sake of appearances. See the calmness
of the night, the solitude of the spot, inviting us to break our
slumbers by a vigil of some sort. Rise as thou livest, and retire a
little distance, and with a good heart and cheerful courage give
thyself three or four hundred lashes on account of Dulcinea's
disenchantment score; and this I entreat of thee, making it a request,
for I have no desire to come to grips with thee a second time, as I
know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou hast laid them on we will
pass the rest of the night, I singing my separation, thou thy
constancy, making a beginning at once with the pastoral life we are to
follow at our village." "Senor," replied Sancho, "I'm no monk to get
up out of the middle of my sleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem
to me that one can pass from one extreme of the pain of whipping to
the other of music. Will your worship let me sleep, and not worry me
about whipping myself? or you'll make me swear never to touch a hair
of my doublet, not to say my flesh." "O hard heart!" said Don Quixote,
"O pitiless squire! O bread ill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged,
both those I have done thee and those I mean to do thee! Through me
hast thou seen thyself a governor, and through me thou seest thyself
in immediate expectation of being a count, or obtaining some other
equivalent title, for I-post tenebras spero lucem." "I don't know what
that is," said Sancho; "all I know is that if the Senora Magallanes or
Magalona was satisfied with this croup, she could not have been very
tender of flesh." The duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were
listening to the conversation of the two heroes, and were beyond
measure amused by it; and now, desirous of putting a finishing touch
to this rare and well-contrived adventure, they applied a light to
Clavileno's tail with some tow, and the horse, being full of squibs
and crackers, immediately blew up with a prodigious noise, and brought
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to the ground half singed. By this time
the bearded band of duennas, the Trifaldi and all, had vanished from
the garden, and those that remained lay stretched on the ground as if
in a swoon. Don Quixote and Sancho got up rather shaken, and, looking
about them, were filled with amazement at finding themselves in the
same garden from which they had started, and seeing such a number of
people stretched on the ground; and their astonishment was increased
when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lance planted in
the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of green silk a smooth
white parchment on which there was the following inscription in large
gold letters: "The illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has, by
merely attempting it, finished and concluded the adventure of the
Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno
is now satisfied on every point, the chins of the duennas are now
smooth and clean, and King Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their
original form; and when the squirely flagellation shall have been
completed, the white dove shall find herself delivered from the
pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her, and in the arms of her
beloved mate; for such is the decree of the sage Merlin,
arch-enchanter of enchanters." As soon as Don Quixote had read the
inscription on the parchment he perceived clearly that it referred to
the disenchantment of Dulcinea, and returning hearty thanks to heaven
that he had with so little danger achieved so grand an exploit as to
restore to their former complexion the countenances of those venerable
duennas, he advanced towards the duke and duchess, who had not yet
come to themselves, and taking the duke by the hand he said, "Be of
good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it's nothing at all; the
adventure is now over and without any harm done, as the inscription
fixed on this post shows plainly." The duke came to himself slowly and
like one recovering consciousness after a heavy sleep, and the duchess
and all who had fallen prostrate about the garden did the same, with
such demonstrations of wonder and amazement that they would have
almost persuaded one that what they pretended so adroitly in jest had
happened to them in reality. The duke read the placard with half-shut
eyes, and then ran to embrace Don Quixote with-open arms, declaring
him to be the best knight that had ever been seen in any age. Sancho
kept looking about for the Distressed One, to see what her face was
like without the beard, and if she was as fair as her elegant person
promised; but they told him that, the instant Clavileno descended
flaming through the air and came to the ground, the whole band of
duennas with the Trifaldi vanished, and that they were already shaved
and without a stump left. The duchess asked Sancho how he had fared on
that long journey, to which Sancho replied, "I felt, senora, that we
were flying through the region of fire, as my master told me, and I
wanted to uncover my eyes for a bit; but my master, when I asked leave
to uncover myself, would not let me; but as I have a little bit of
curiosity about me, and a desire to know what is forbidden and kept
from me, quietly and without anyone seeing me I drew aside the
handkerchief covering my eyes ever so little, close to my nose, and
from underneath looked towards the earth, and it seemed to me that it
was altogether no bigger than a grain of mustard seed, and that the
men walking on it were little bigger than hazel nuts; so you may see
how high we must have got to then." To this the duchess said, "Sancho,
my friend, mind what you are saying; it seems you could not have seen
the earth, but only the men walking on it; for if the earth looked to
you like a grain of mustard seed, and each man like a hazel nut, one
man alone would have covered the whole earth." "That is true," said
Sancho, "but for all that I got a glimpse of a bit of one side of it,
and saw it all." "Take care, Sancho," said the duchess, "with a bit of
one side one does not see the whole of what one looks at." "I don't
understand that way of looking at things," said Sancho; "I only know
that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind that as we were flying
by enchantment so I might have seen the whole earth and all the men by
enchantment whatever way I looked; and if you won't believe this, no
more will you believe that, uncovering myself nearly to the eyebrows,
I saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palm and a half
between me and it; and by everything that I can swear by, senora, it
is mighty great! And it so happened we came by where the seven goats
are, and by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was a goatherd in
my own country, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing to be among
them for a little, and if I had not given way to it I think I'd have
burst. So I come and take, and what do I do? without saying anything
to anybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I got down from
Clavileno and amused myself with the goats--which are like violets,
like flowers--for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavileno never
stirred or moved from one spot." "And while the good Sancho was
amusing himself with the goats," said the duke, "how did Senor Don
Quixote amuse himself?" To which Don Quixote replied, "As all these
things and such like occurrences are out of the ordinary course of
nature, it is no wonder that Sancho says what he does; for my own part
I can only say that I did not uncover my eyes either above or below,
nor did I see sky or earth or sea or shore. It is true I felt that I
was passing through the region of the air, and even that I touched
that of fire; but that we passed farther I cannot believe; for the
region of fire being between the heaven of the moon and the last
region of the air, we could not have reached that heaven where the
seven goats Sancho speaks of are without being burned; and as we were
not burned, either Sancho is lying or Sancho is dreaming." "I am
neither lying nor dreaming," said Sancho; "only ask me the tokens of
those same goats, and you'll see by that whether I'm telling the truth
or not." "Tell us them then, Sancho," said the duchess. "Two of them,"
said Sancho, "are green, two blood-red, two blue, and one a mixture of
all colours." "An odd sort of goat, that," said the duke; "in this
earthly region of ours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such
colours." "That's very plain," said Sancho; "of course there must be a
difference between the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth."
"Tell me, Sancho," said the duke, "did you see any he-goat among those
goats?" "No, senor," said Sancho; "but I have heard say that none ever
passed the horns of the moon." They did not care to ask him anything
more about his journey, for they saw he was in the vein to go rambling
all over the heavens giving an account of everything that went on
there, without having ever stirred from the garden. Such, in short,
was the end of the adventure of the Distressed Duenna, which gave the
duke and duchess laughing matter not only for the time being, but for
all their lives, and Sancho something to talk about for ages, if he
lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming close to his ear, said to him,
"Sancho, as you would have us believe what you saw in heaven, I
require you to believe me as to what I saw in the cave of Montesinos;
I say no more." CHAPTER XLII. OF THE COUNSELS WHICH DON QUIXOTE GAVE
SANCHO PANZA BEFORE HE SET OUT TO GOVERN THE ISLAND, TOGETHER WITH
OTHER WELL-CONSIDERED MATTERS The duke and duchess were so well
pleased with the successful and droll result of the adventure of the
Distressed One, that they resolved to carry on the joke, seeing what a
fit subject they had to deal with for making it all pass for reality.
So having laid their plans and given instructions to their servants
and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his government of the promised
island, the next day, that following Clavileno's flight, the duke told
Sancho to prepare and get ready to go and be governor, for his
islanders were already looking out for him as for the showers of May;
and she taking hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by
the hand, while the daughter led Dapple, they made for their house,
leaving Don Quixote in his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper,
and in the company of the curate and the bachelor. Don Quixote at
once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in private with
the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them of his
defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his village for
a year, which he meant to keep to the letter without departing a
hair's breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by scrupulous
good faith and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he thought of
turning shepherd for that year, and taking his diversion in the
solitude of the fields, where he could with perfect freedom give range
to his thoughts of love while he followed the virtuous pastoral
calling; and he besought them, if they had not a great deal to do and
were not prevented by more important business, to consent to be his
companions, for he would buy sheep enough to qualify them for
shepherds; and the most important point of the whole affair, he could
tell them, was settled, for he had given them names that would fit
them to a T. The curate asked what they were. Don Quixote replied that
he himself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and the bachelor
the shepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, and
Sancho Panza the shepherd Pancino. Both were astounded at Don
Quixote's new craze; however, lest he should once more make off out of
the village from them in pursuit of his chivalry, they trusting that
in the course of the year he might be cured, fell in with his new
project, applauded his crazy idea as a bright one, and offered to
share the life with him. "And what's more," said Samson Carrasco, "I
am, as all the world knows, a very famous poet, and I'll be always
making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as it may come into my head,
to pass away our time in those secluded regions where we shall be
roaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that each of us should
choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his verses,
and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, without
writing up and carving her name on it, as is the habit and custom of
love-smitten shepherds." "That's the very thing," said Don Quixote;
"though I am relieved from looking for the name of an imaginary
shepherdess, for there's the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory
of these brooksides, the ornament of these meadows, the mainstay of
beauty, the cream of all the graces, and, in a word, the being to whom
all praise is appropriate, be it ever so hyperbolical." "Very true,"
said the curate; "but we the others must look about for accommodating
shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or another." "And,"
added Samson Carrasco, "if they fail us, we can call them by the names
of the ones in print that the world is filled with, Filidas,
Amarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they sell
them in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our
own. If my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called
Ana, I'll sing her praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca,
I'll call her Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to
the same thing; and Sancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may
glorify his wife Teresa Panza as Teresaina." Don Quixote laughed at
the adaptation of the name, and the curate bestowed vast praise upon
the worthy and honourable resolution he had made, and again offered to
bear him company all the time that he could spare from his imperative
duties. And so they took their leave of him, recommending and
beseeching him to take care of his health and treat himself to a
suitable diet. It so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard
all the three of them said; and as soon as they were gone they both of
them came in to Don Quixote, and said the niece, "What's this, uncle?
Now that we were thinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a
quiet respectable life there, are you going to get into fresh
entanglements, and turn 'young shepherd, thou that comest here, young
shepherd going there?' Nay! indeed 'the straw is too hard now to make
pipes of.'" "And," added the housekeeper, "will your worship be able
to bear, out in the fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of
winter, and the howling of the wolves? Not you; for that's a life and
a business for hardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from
the time they were in swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils,
it's better to be a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, senor;
take my advice--and I'm not giving it to you full of bread and wine,
but fasting, and with fifty years upon my head--stay at home, look
after your affairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and
upon my soul be it if any evil comes to you." "Hold your peace, my
daughters," said Don Quixote; "I know very well what my duty is; help
me to bed, for I don't feel very well; and rest assured that,
knight-errant now or wandering shepherd to be, I shall never fail to
have a care for your interests, as you will see in the end." And the
good wenches (for that they undoubtedly were), the housekeeper and
niece, helped him to bed, where they gave him something to eat and
made him as comfortable as possible. CHAPTER LXXIV. OF HOW DON QUIXOTE
FELL SICK, AND OF THE WILL HE MADE, AND HOW HE DIED DON QUIXOTE PART
II. DEDICATION OF PART II. TO THE COUNT OF LEMOS: These days past,
when sending Your Excellency my plays, that had appeared in print
before being shown on the stage, I said, if I remember well, that Don
Quixote was putting on his spurs to go and render homage to Your
Excellency. Now I say that "with his spurs, he is on his way." Should
he reach destination methinks I shall have rendered some service to
Your Excellency, as from many parts I am urged to send him off, so as
to dispel the loathing and disgust caused by another Don Quixote who,
under the name of Second Part, has run masquerading through the whole
world. And he who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the
great Emperor of China, who wrote me a letter in Chinese a month ago
and sent it by a special courier. He asked me, or to be truthful, he
begged me to send him Don Quixote, for he intended to found a college
where the Spanish tongue would be taught, and it was his wish that the
book to be read should be the History of Don Quixote. He also added
that I should go and be the rector of this college. I asked the bearer
if His Majesty had afforded a sum in aid of my travel expenses. He
answered, "No, not even in thought." "Then, brother," I replied, "you
can return to your China, post haste or at whatever haste you are
bound to go, as I am not fit for so long a travel and, besides being
ill, I am very much without money, while Emperor for Emperor and
Monarch for Monarch, I have at Naples the great Count of Lemos, who,
without so many petty titles of colleges and rectorships, sustains me,
protects me and does me more favour than I can wish for." Thus I gave
him his leave and I beg mine from you, offering Your Excellency the
"Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda," a book I shall finish within four
months, Deo volente, and which will be either the worst or the best
that has been composed in our language, I mean of those intended for
entertainment; at which I repent of having called it the worst, for,
in the opinion of friends, it is bound to attain the summit of
possible quality. May Your Excellency return in such health that is
wished you; Persiles will be ready to kiss your hand and I your feet,
being as I am, Your Excellency's most humble servant. From Madrid,
this last day of October of the year one thousand six hundred and
fifteen. At the service of Your Excellency: MIGUEL DE CERVANTES
SAAVEDRA VOLUME II. THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE God bless me, gentle (or it
may be plebeian) reader, how eagerly must thou be looking forward to
this preface, expecting to find there retaliation, scolding, and abuse
against the author of the second Don Quixote--I mean him who was, they
say, begotten at Tordesillas and born at Tarragona! Well then, the
truth is, I am not going to give thee that satisfaction; for, though
injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in mine the rule must admit
of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call him ass, fool, and
malapert, but I have no such intention; let his offence be his
punishment, with his bread let him eat it, and there's an end of it.
What I cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old
and one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from
passing over me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about
in some tavern, and not on the grandest occasion the past or present
has seen, or the future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty
to the beholder's eye, they are, at least, honourable in the
estimation of those who know where they were received; for the soldier
shows to greater advantage dead in battle than alive in flight; and so
strongly is this my feeling, that if now it were proposed to perform
an impossibility for me, I would rather have had my share in that
mighty action, than be free from my wounds this minute without having
been present at it. Those the soldier shows on his face and breast are
stars that direct others to the heaven of honour and ambition of
merited praise; and moreover it is to be observed that it is not with
grey hairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and that
commonly improves with years. I take it amiss, too, that he calls me
envious, and explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; for
really and truly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which
is holy, noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not
likely to attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he holds the
rank of familiar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on
account of him on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely
mistaken; for I worship the genius of that person, and admire his
works and his unceasing and strenuous industry. After all, I am
grateful to this gentleman, the author, for saying that my novels are
more satirical than exemplary, but that they are good; for they could
not be that unless there was a little of everything in them. I suspect
thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and keeping myself
too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a feeling that
additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer, and that
what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great, as he
does not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight, but
hides his name and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of
some lese majesty. If perchance thou shouldst come to know him, tell
him from me that I do not hold myself aggrieved; for I know well what
the temptations of the devil are, and that one of the greatest is
putting it into a man's head that he can write and print a book by
which he will get as much fame as money, and as much money as fame;
and to prove it I will beg of you, in your own sprightly, pleasant
way, to tell him this story. There was a madman in Seville who took to
one of the drollest absurdities and vagaries that ever madman in the
world gave way to. It was this: he made a tube of reed sharp at one
end, and catching a dog in the street, or wherever it might be, he
with his foot held one of its legs fast, and with his hand lifted up
the other, and as best he could fixed the tube where, by blowing, he
made the dog as round as a ball; then holding it in this position, he
gave it a couple of slaps on the belly, and let it go, saying to the
bystanders (and there were always plenty of them): "Do your worships
think, now, that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog?"--Does your
worship think now, that it is an easy thing to write a book? And if
this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell him this one,
which is likewise of a madman and a dog. In Cordova there was another
madman, whose way it was to carry a piece of marble slab or a stone,
not of the lightest, on his head, and when he came upon any unwary dog
he used to draw close to him and let the weight fall right on top of
him; on which the dog in a rage, barking and howling, would run three
streets without stopping. It so happened, however, that one of the
dogs he discharged his load upon was a cap-maker's dog, of which his
master was very fond. The stone came down hitting it on the head, the
dog raised a yell at the blow, the master saw the affair and was
wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed out at the madman and
did not leave a sound bone in his body, and at every stroke he gave
him he said, "You dog, you thief! my lurcher! Don't you see, you
brute, that my dog is a lurcher?" and so, repeating the word "lurcher"
again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to a jelly. The madman
took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more than a month
never once showed himself in public; but after that he came out again
with his old trick and a heavier load than ever. He came up to where
there was a dog, and examining it very carefully without venturing to
let the stone fall, he said: "This is a lurcher; ware!" In short, all
the dogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he said were
lurchers; and he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will be the same
with this historian; that he will not venture another time to
discharge the weight of his wit in books, which, being bad, are harder
than stones. Tell him, too, that I do not care a farthing for the
threat he holds out to me of depriving me of my profit by means of his
book; for, to borrow from the famous interlude of "The Perendenga," I
say in answer to him, "Long life to my lord the Veintiquatro, and
Christ be with us all." Long life to the great Conde de Lemos, whose
Christian charity and well-known generosity support me against all the
strokes of my curst fortune; and long life to the supreme benevolence
of His Eminence of Toledo, Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas; and what
matter if there be no printing-presses in the world, or if they print
more books against me than there are letters in the verses of Mingo
Revulgo! These two princes, unsought by any adulation or flattery of
mine, of their own goodness alone, have taken it upon them to show me
kindness and protect me, and in this I consider myself happier and
richer than if Fortune had raised me to her greatest height in the
ordinary way. The poor man may retain honour, but not the vicious;
poverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot hide it altogether;
and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even though it be
through the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem of lofty
and noble spirits, and in consequence their protection. Thou needst
say no more to him, nor will I say anything more to thee, save to tell
thee to bear in mind that this Second Part of "Don Quixote" which I
offer thee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth as the
First, and that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued, and at
length dead and buried, so that no one may dare to bring forward any
further evidence against him, for that already produced is sufficient;
and suffice it, too, that some reputable person should have given an
account of all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into the
matter again; for abundance, even of good things, prevents them from
being valued; and scarcity, even in the case of what is bad, confers a
certain value. I was forgetting to tell thee that thou mayest expect
the "Persiles," which I am now finishing, and also the Second Part of
"Galatea." CHAPTER I. OF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER HAD
WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUT HIS MALADY CHAPTER II WHICH TREATS OF THE
NOTABLE ALTERCATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE'S NIECE,
AND HOUSEKEEPER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DROLL MATTERS The history relates
that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and the barber heard came
from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to Sancho, who was
striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote while they held the
door against him, "What does the vagabond want in this house? Be off
to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else, that delude my
master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about the country."
To which Sancho replied, "Devil's own housekeeper! it is I who am
deluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and not
thy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightily
mistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an
island, which I am still waiting for." "May evil islands choke thee,
thou detestable Sancho," said the niece; "What are islands? Is it
something to eat, glutton and gormandiser that thou art?" "It is not
something to eat," replied Sancho, "but something to govern and rule,
and better than four cities or four judgeships at court." "For all
that," said the housekeeper, "you don't enter here, you bag of
mischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig your
seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands." The curate
and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of the
three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt out a
whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that
might not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the
other two hold their tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and
the curate and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose
recovery they despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy
ideas, and how saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry;
and said the curate to the barber, "You will see, gossip, that when we
are least thinking of it, our gentleman will be off once more for
another flight." "I have no doubt of it," returned the barber; "but I
do not wonder so much at the madness of the knight as at the
simplicity of the squire, who has such a firm belief in all that about
the island, that I suppose all the exposures that could be imagined
would not get it out of his head." "God help them," said the curate;
"and let us be on the look-out to see what comes of all these
absurdities of the knight and squire, for it seems as if they had both
been cast in the same mould, and the madness of the master without the
simplicity of the man would not be worth a farthing." "That is true,"
said the barber, "and I should like very much to know what the pair
are talking about at this moment." "I promise you," said the curate,
"the niece or the housekeeper will tell us by-and-by, for they are not
the ones to forget to listen." Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up
in his room with Sancho, and when they were alone he said to him, "It
grieves me greatly, Sancho, that thou shouldst have said, and sayest,
that I took thee out of thy cottage, when thou knowest I did not
remain in my house. We sallied forth together, we took the road
together, we wandered abroad together; we have had the same fortune
and the same luck; if they blanketed thee once, they belaboured me a
hundred times, and that is the only advantage I have of thee." "That
was only reasonable," replied Sancho, "for, by what your worship says,
misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant than to their
squires." "Thou art mistaken, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "according to
the maxim quando caput dolet, etc." "I don't understand any language
but my own," said Sancho. "I mean to say," said Don Quixote, "that
when the head suffers all the members suffer; and so, being thy lord
and master, I am thy head, and thou a part of me as thou art my
servant; and therefore any evil that affects or shall affect me should
give thee pain, and what affects thee give pain to me." "It should be
so," said Sancho; "but when I was blanketed as a member, my head was
on the other side of the wall, looking on while I was flying through
the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if the members are
obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it should be obliged to
feel their sufferings." "Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "that I did not feel when they were blanketing thee? If thou
dost, thou must not say so or think so, for I felt more pain then in
spirit than thou didst in body. But let us put that aside for the
present, for we shall have opportunities enough for considering and
settling the point; tell me, Sancho my friend, what do they say about
me in the village here? What do the common people think of me? What do
the hidalgos? What do the caballeros? What do they say of my valour;
of my achievements; of my courtesy? How do they treat the task I have
undertaken in reviving and restoring to the world the now forgotten
order of chivalry? In short, Sancho, I would have thee tell me all
that has come to thine ears on this subject; and thou art to tell me,
without adding anything to the good or taking away anything from the
bad; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to tell the truth to their
lords just as it is and in its proper shape, not allowing flattery to
add to it or any idle deference to lessen it. And I would have thee
know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in the world; some
there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings and princes,
whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point like
a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common herd and
go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords; so that
the difference is that the one were what they no longer are, and the
others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such that
after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with which
the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and
should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though she
well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for
her lord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to
seizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death
will put an end to the wrath of her parents." "It comes to this, too,"
said Sancho, "what some naughty people say, 'Never ask as a favour
what thou canst take by force;' though it would fit better to say, 'A
clear escape is better than good men's prayers.' I say so because if
my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law, will not condescend to
give you my lady the princess, there is nothing for it but, as your
worship says, to seize her and transport her. But the mischief is that
until peace is made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of your
kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards go, unless it
be that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes with the
princess, and that with her he tides over his bad luck until Heaven
otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose, may as well give
her to him at once for a lawful wife." "Nobody can object to that,"
said Don Quixote. "Then since that may be," said Sancho, "there is
nothing for it but to commend ourselves to God, and let fortune take
what course it will." "God guide it according to my wishes and thy
wants," said Don Quixote, "and mean be he who thinks himself mean."
"In God's name let him be so," said Sancho: "I am an old Christian,
and to fit me for a count that's enough." "And more than enough for
thee," said Don Quixote; "and even wert thou not, it would make no
difference, because I being the king can easily give thee nobility
without purchase or service rendered by thee, for when I make thee a
count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they may say what they
will, but by my faith they will have to call thee 'your lordship,'
whether they like it or not." "Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to
support the tittle," said Sancho. "Title thou shouldst say, not
tittle," said his master. "So be it," answered Sancho. "I say I will
know how to behave, for once in my life I was beadle of a brotherhood,
and the beadle's gown sat so well on me that all said I looked as if I
was to be steward of the same brotherhood. What will it be, then, when
I put a duke's robe on my back, or dress myself in gold and pearls
like a count? I believe they'll come a hundred leagues to see me."
"Thou wilt look well," said Don Quixote, "but thou must shave thy
beard often, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if
thou dost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what
thou art at the distance of a musket shot." "What more will it be,"
said Sancho, "than having a barber, and keeping him at wages in the
house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him go behind me like
a nobleman's equerry." "Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have
equerries behind them?" asked Don Quixote. "I will tell you," answered
Sancho. "Years ago I was for a month at the capital and there I saw
taking the air a very small gentleman who they said was a very great
man, and a man following him on horseback in every turn he took, just
as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did not join the other
man, instead of always going behind him; they answered me that he was
his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have such
persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never
forgotten it." "Thou art right," said Don Quixote, "and I cannot guess
or explain what this may mean; but stay; let us see if in this
memorandum book there is anything written by which we may be able to
trace out or discover what we want to know." He opened it, and the
first thing he found in it, written roughly but in a very good hand,
was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho might hear it, he found
that it ran as follows: SONNET Or Love is lacking in intelligence, Or
to the height of cruelty attains, Or else it is my doom to suffer
pains Beyond the measure due to my offence. But if Love be a God, it
follows thence That he knows all, and certain it remains No God loves
cruelty; then who ordains This penance that enthrals while it
torments? It were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name; Such evil with
such goodness cannot live; And against Heaven I dare not charge the
blame, I only know it is my fate to die. To him who knows not whence
his malady A miracle alone a cure can give. "There is nothing to be
learned from that rhyme," said Sancho, "unless by that clue there's in
it, one may draw out the ball of the whole matter." "What clue is
there?" said Don Quixote. "I thought your worship spoke of a clue in
it," said Sancho. "I only said Chloe," replied Don Quixote; "and that
no doubt, is the name of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet
complains; and, faith, he must be a tolerable poet, or I know little
of the craft." "Then your worship understands rhyming too?" "And
better than thou thinkest," replied Don Quixote, "as thou shalt see
when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to
my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho, that
in this there is no condition more hazardous than that of
adventurers." "That is true," said Sancho, "since the mere noise of
the hammers of a fulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of
such a valiant errant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure
I will not open my lips henceforward to make light of anything of your
worship's, but only to honour you as my master and natural lord." "By
so doing," replied Don Quixote, "shalt thou live long on the face of
the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as though
they were parents." CHAPTER XXI. WHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE
AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO'S HELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT
HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT It now began to rain a little, and
Sancho was for going into the fulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken
such an abhorrence to them on account of the late joke that he would
not enter them on any account; so turning aside to right they came
upon another road, different from that which they had taken the night
before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man on horseback
who wore on his head something that shone like gold, and the moment he
saw him he turned to Sancho and said: "I think, Sancho, there is no
proverb that is not true, all being maxims drawn from experience
itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially that one that says,
'Where one door shuts, another opens.' I say so because if last night
fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us,
cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens wide another one for
another better and more certain adventure, and if I do not contrive to
enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance
of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. I say this because, if
I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on his head the
helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou
rememberest." "Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what
you do," said Sancho, "for I don't want any more fulling mills to
finish off fulling and knocking our senses out." "The devil take thee,
man," said Don Quixote; "what has a helmet to do with fulling mills?"
"I don't know," replied Sancho, "but, faith, if I might speak as I
used, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see
you were mistaken in what you say." "How can I be mistaken in what I
say, unbelieving traitor?" returned Don Quixote; "tell me, seest thou
not yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled grey steed, who has
upon his head a helmet of gold?" "What I see and make out," answered
Sancho, "is only a man on a grey ass like my own, who has something
that shines on his head." "Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino," said
Don Quixote; "stand to one side and leave me alone with him; thou
shalt see how, without saying a word, to save time, I shall bring this
adventure to an issue and possess myself of the helmet I have so
longed for." "I will take care to stand aside," said Sancho; "but God
grant, I say once more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling
mills." "I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those
fulling mills to me again," said Don Quixote, "or I vow--and I say no
more-I'll full the soul out of you." Sancho held his peace in dread
lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl at
him. The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight
that Don Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two
villages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop
nor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of
the larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who
required to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on
this errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but
as luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and not
to spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on
his head, and being clean it glittered at half a league's distance. He
rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem
to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden
helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy
chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw
near, without entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante's top
speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low, fully
determined to run him through and through, and as he reached him,
without checking the fury of his charge, he cried to him: "Defend
thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that which
is so reasonably my due." The barber, who without any expectation or
apprehension of it saw this apparition coming down upon him, had no
other way of saving himself from the stroke of the lance but to let
himself fall off his ass; and no sooner had he touched the ground than
he sprang up more nimbly than a deer and sped away across the plain
faster than the wind. He left the basin on the ground, with which Don
Quixote contented himself, saying that the pagan had shown his
discretion and imitated the beaver, which finding itself pressed by
the hunters bites and cuts off with its teeth that for which, by its
natural instinct, it knows it is pursued. He told Sancho to pick up
the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said: "By God the basin is a
good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth a maravedis," and
handed it to his master, who immediately put it on his head, turning
it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment, and not
finding it he said, "Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous
head-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the
worst of it is half of it is wanting." When Sancho heard him call the
basin a headpiece he was unable to restrain his laughter, but
remembering his master's wrath he checked himself in the midst of it.
"What art thou laughing at, Sancho?" said Don Quixote. "I am
laughing," said he, "to think of the great head the pagan must have
had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular
barber's basin." "Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?" said Don
Quixote; "that this wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by
some strange accident have come into the hands of some one who was
unable to recognise or realise its value, and who, not knowing what he
did, and seeing it to be of the purest gold, must have melted down one
half for the sake of what it might be worth, and of the other made
this which is like a barber's basin as thou sayest; but be it as it
may, to me who recognise it, its transformation makes no difference,
for I will set it to rights at the first village where there is a
blacksmith, and in such style that that helmet the god of smithies
forged for the god of battles shall not surpass it or even come up to
it; and in the meantime I will wear it as well as I can, for something
is better than nothing; all the more as it will be quite enough to
protect me from any chance blow of a stone." "That is," said Sancho,
"if it is not shot with a sling as they were in the battle of the two
armies, when they signed the cross on your worship's grinders and
smashed the flask with that blessed draught that made me vomit my
bowels up." "It does not grieve me much to have lost it," said Don
Quixote, "for thou knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my
memory." "So have I," answered Sancho, "but if ever I make it, or try
it again as long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have
no intention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean,
with all my five senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from
wounding anyone: as to being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is
hard to prevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is
nothing for it but to squeeze our shoulders together, hold our breath,
shut our eyes, and let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may
send us." "Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho," said Don Quixote on
hearing this, "for once an injury has been done thee thou never
forgettest it: but know that it is the part of noble and generous
hearts not to attach importance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou
got by it, what broken rib, what cracked head, that thou canst not
forget that jest? For jest and sport it was, properly regarded, and
had I not seen it in that light I would have returned and done more
mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did for the rape of Helen,
who, if she were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had lived then, might
depend upon it she would not be so famous for her beauty as she is;"
and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said Sancho, "Let it
pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but I know what
sort of jest and earnest it was, and I know it will never be rubbed
out of my memory any more than off my shoulders. But putting that
aside, will your worship tell me what are we to do with this
dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass, which that Martino that
your worship overthrew has left deserted here? for, from the way he
took to his heels and bolted, he is not likely ever to come back for
it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one." "I have never been in
the habit," said Don Quixote, "of taking spoil of those whom I
vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away their horses
and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the victor have
lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to take that of
the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore, Sancho, leave
this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be; for when its
owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it." "God knows I
should like to take it," returned Sancho, "or at least to change it
for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily the laws
of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let one ass
be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at least
change trappings." "On that head I am not quite certain," answered Don
Quixote, "and the matter being doubtful, pending better information, I
say thou mayest change them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them."
"So urgent is it," answered Sancho, "that if they were for my own
person I could not want them more;" and forthwith, fortified by this
licence, he effected the mutatio capparum, rigging out his beast to
the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done, they
broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from
the sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling
mills, without casting a look in that direction, in such loathing did
they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and, all anger and
gloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixed road (not to
fix upon any being the proper thing for true knights-errant), they set
out, guided by Rocinante's will, which carried along with it that of
his master, not to say that of the ass, which always followed him
wherever he led, lovingly and sociably; nevertheless they returned to
the high road, and pursued it at a venture without any other aim. As
they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master, "Senor,
would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For since
you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have
gone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my
tongue that I don't want to be spoiled." "Say, on, Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "and be brief in thy discourse, for there is no pleasure in
one that is long." "Well then, senor," returned Sancho, "I say that
for some days past I have been considering how little is got or gained
by going in search of these adventures that your worship seeks in
these wilds and cross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are
victoriously achieved, there is no one to see or know of them, and so
they must be left untold for ever, to the loss of your worship's
object and the credit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would
be better (saving your worship's better judgment) if we were to go and
serve some emperor or other great prince who may have some war on
hand, in whose service your worship may prove the worth of your
person, your great might, and greater understanding, on perceiving
which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward
us, each according to his merits; and there you will not be at a loss
for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to
preserve their memory for ever. Of my own I say nothing, as they will
not go beyond squirely limits, though I make bold to say that, if it
be the practice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires, I
think mine must not be left out." "Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,"
answered Don Quixote, "but before that point is reached it is
requisite to roam the world, as it were on probation, seeking
adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and fame may be
acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of some great
monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds, and that the
boys, the instant they see him enter the gate of the city, may all
follow him and surround him, crying, 'This is the Knight of the
Sun'-or the Serpent, or any other title under which he may have
achieved great deeds. 'This,' they will say, 'is he who vanquished in
single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength; he who
delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long enchantment
under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.' So from one to
another they will go proclaiming his achievements; and presently at
the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that kingdom will
appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon as he beholds
the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on his shield,
he will as a matter of course say, 'What ho! Forth all ye, the knights
of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh hither!' At
which command all will issue forth, and he himself, advancing half-way
down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and salute him, kissing him
on the cheek, and will then lead him to the queen's chamber, where the
knight will find her with the princess her daughter, who will be one
of the most beautiful and accomplished damsels that could with the
utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the known world. Straightway it
will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon the knight and he
his upon her, and each will seem to the other something more divine
than human, and, without knowing how or why they will be taken and
entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and sorely distressed in
their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and sufferings
known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no doubt, to some richly
adorned chamber of the palace, where, having removed his armour, they
will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself, and
if he looked noble in his armour he will look still more so in a
doublet. When night comes he will sup with the king, queen, and
princess; and all the time he will never take his eyes off her,
stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she will do
the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a damsel
of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through the
door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf
followed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain
adventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he who shall achieve it
shall be deemed the best knight in the world. "The king will then
command all those present to essay it, and none will bring it to an
end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the great enhancement
of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will esteem
herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her thoughts so
high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or whatever he
is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as
himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his
court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war.
The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously
kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that night he will take
leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she
sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he has already many
times conversed with her, the go-between and confidante in the matter
being a damsel much trusted by the princess. He will sigh, she will
swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much distressed because morning
approaches, and for the honour of her lady he would not that they were
discovered; at last the princess will come to herself and will present
her white hands through the grating to the knight, who will kiss them
a thousand and a thousand times, bathing them with his tears. It will
be arranged between them how they are to inform each other of their
good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreat him to make his
absence as short as possible, which he will promise to do with many
oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes his leave in such
grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes him thence to his
chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for sorrow at
parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of the king,
queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair, it is
told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive a visit;
the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heart is
pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. The
confidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, who
listens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not
knowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or
not; the damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and
gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any
save one who was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved,
and she strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion
in her parents, and at the end of two days she appears in public.
Meanwhile the knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war,
conquers the king's enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles,
returns to the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and
it is agreed that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as
the reward of his services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he
knows not who he is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in
whatever other way it may be, the princess comes to be his bride, and
her father comes to regard it as very good fortune; for it so happens
that this knight is proved to be the son of a valiant king of some
kingdom, I know not what, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the
map. The father dies, the princess inherits, and in two words the
knight becomes king. And here comes in at once the bestowal of rewards
upon his squire and all who have aided him in rising to so exalted a
rank. He marries his squire to a damsel of the princess's, who will
be, no doubt, the one who was confidante in their amour, and is
daughter of a very great duke." "That's what I want, and no mistake
about it!" said Sancho. "That's what I'm waiting for; for all this,
word for word, is in store for your worship under the title of the
Knight of the Rueful Countenance." "Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,"
replied Don Quixote, "for in the same manner, and by the same steps as
I have described here, knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings
and emperors; all we want now is to find out what king, Christian or
pagan, is at war and has a beautiful daughter; but there will be time
enough to think of that, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in
other quarters before repairing to the court. There is another thing,
too, that is wanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and
has a beautiful daughter, and that I have won incredible fame
throughout the universe, I know not how it can be made out that I am
of royal lineage, or even second cousin to an emperor; for the king
will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is
first thoroughly satisfied on this point, however much my famous deeds
may deserve it; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my
arm has fairly earned. True it is I am a gentleman of known house, of
estate and property, and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulct;
and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear
up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in
descent from a king; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that the
valour which is not based upon a foundation of prudence is called
rashness, and the exploits of the rash man are to be attributed rather
to good fortune than to courage; and so I own that I retired, but not
that I fled; and therein I have followed the example of many valiant
men who have reserved themselves for better times; the histories are
full of instances of this, but as it would not be any good to thee or
pleasure to me, I will not recount them to thee now." Sancho was by
this time mounted with the help of Don Quixote, who then himself
mounted Rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to take
shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off.
Every now and then Sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans,
and on Don Quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering, he
replied that, from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of his
neck, he was so sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses. "The
cause of that soreness," said Don Quixote, "will be, no doubt, that
the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long one, it caught
thee all down the back, where all the parts that are sore are
situated, and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still."
"By God," said Sancho, "your worship has relieved me of a great doubt,
and cleared up the point for me in elegant style! Body o' me! is the
cause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I
am sore everywhere the staff hit me? If it was my ankles that pained
me there might be something in going divining why they did, but it is
not much to divine that I'm sore where they thrashed me. By my faith,
master mine, the ills of others hang by a hair; every day I am
discovering more and more how little I have to hope for from keeping
company with your worship; for if this time you have allowed me to be
drubbed, the next time, or a hundred times more, we'll have the
blanketings of the other day over again, and all the other pranks
which, if they have fallen on my shoulders now, will be thrown in my
teeth by-and-by. I would do a great deal better (if I was not an
ignorant brute that will never do any good all my life), I would do a
great deal better, I say, to go home to my wife and children and
support them and bring them up on what God may please to give me,
instead of following your worship along roads that lead nowhere and
paths that are none at all, with little to drink and less to eat. And
then when it comes to sleeping! Measure out seven feet on the earth,
brother squire, and if that's not enough for you, take as many more,
for you may have it all your own way and stretch yourself to your
heart's content. Oh that I could see burnt and turned to ashes the
first man that meddled with knight-errantry or at any rate the first
who chose to be squire to such fools as all the knights-errant of past
times must have been! Of those of the present day I say nothing,
because, as your worship is one of them, I respect them, and because I
know your worship knows a point more than the devil in all you say and
think." "I would lay a good wager with you, Sancho," said Don Quixote,
"that now that you are talking on without anyone to stop you, you
don't feel a pain in your whole body. Talk away, my son, say whatever
comes into your head or mouth, for so long as you feel no pain, the
irritation your impertinences give me will be a pleasure to me; and if
you are so anxious to go home to your wife and children, God forbid
that I should prevent you; you have money of mine; see how long it is
since we left our village this third time, and how much you can and
ought to earn every month, and pay yourself out of your own hand."
"When I worked for Tom Carrasco, the father of the bachelor Samson
Carrasco that your worship knows," replied Sancho, "I used to earn two
ducats a month besides my food; I can't tell what I can earn with your
worship, though I know a knight-errant's squire has harder times of it
than he who works for a farmer; for after all, we who work for
farmers, however much we toil all day, at the worst, at night, we have
our olla supper and sleep in a bed, which I have not slept in since I
have been in your worship's service, if it wasn't the short time we
were in Don Diego de Miranda's house, and the feast I had with the
skimmings I took off Camacho's pots, and what I ate, drank, and slept
in Basilio's house; all the rest of the time I have been sleeping on
the hard ground under the open sky, exposed to what they call the
inclemencies of heaven, keeping life in me with scraps of cheese and
crusts of bread, and drinking water either from the brooks or from the
springs we come to on these by-paths we travel." "I own, Sancho," said
Don Quixote, "that all thou sayest is true; how much, thinkest thou,
ought I to give thee over and above what Tom Carrasco gave thee?" "I
think," said Sancho, "that if your worship was to add on two reals a
month I'd consider myself well paid; that is, as far as the wages of
my labour go; but to make up to me for your worship's pledge and
promise to me to give me the government of an island, it would be fair
to add six reals more, making thirty in all." "Very good," said Don
Quixote; "it is twenty-five days since we left our village, so reckon
up, Sancho, according to the wages you have made out for yourself, and
see how much I owe you in proportion, and pay yourself, as I said
before, out of your own hand." "O body o' me!" said Sancho, "but your
worship is very much out in that reckoning; for when it comes to the
promise of the island we must count from the day your worship promised
it to me to this present hour we are at now." "Well, how long is it,
Sancho, since I promised it to you?" said Don Quixote. "If I remember
rightly," said Sancho, "it must be over twenty years, three days more
or less." Don Quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and
began to laugh heartily, and said he, "Why, I have not been wandering,
either in the Sierra Morena or in the whole course of our sallies, but
barely two months, and thou sayest, Sancho, that it is twenty years
since I promised thee the island. I believe now thou wouldst have all
the money thou hast of mine go in thy wages. If so, and if that be thy
pleasure, I give it to thee now, once and for all, and much good may
it do thee, for so long as I see myself rid of such a good-for-nothing
squire I'll be glad to be left a pauper without a rap. But tell me,
thou perverter of the squirely rules of knight-errantry, where hast
thou ever seen or read that any knight-errant's squire made terms with
his lord, 'you must give me so much a month for serving you'? Plunge,
scoundrel, rogue, monster--for such I take thee to be--plunge, I say,
into the mare magnum of their histories; and if thou shalt find that
any squire ever said or thought what thou hast said now, I will let
thee nail it on my forehead, and give me, over and above, four sound
slaps in the face. Turn the rein, or the halter, of thy Dapple, and
begone home; for one single step further thou shalt not make in my
company. O bread thanklessly received! O promises ill-bestowed! O man
more beast than human being! Now, when I was about to raise thee to
such a position, that, in spite of thy wife, they would call thee 'my
lord,' thou art leaving me? Thou art going now when I had a firm and
fixed intention of making thee lord of the best island in the world?
Well, as thou thyself hast said before now, honey is not for the mouth
of the ass. Ass thou art, ass thou wilt be, and ass thou wilt end when
the course of thy life is run; for I know it will come to its close
before thou dost perceive or discern that thou art a beast." Sancho
regarded Don Quixote earnestly while he was giving him this rating,
and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his eyes, and in
a piteous and broken voice he said to him, "Master mine, I confess
that, to be a complete ass, all I want is a tail; if your worship will
only fix one on to me, I'll look on it as rightly placed, and I'll
serve you as an ass all the remaining days of my life. Forgive me and
have pity on my folly, and remember I know but little, and, if I talk
much, it's more from infirmity than malice; but he who sins and mends
commends himself to God." "I should have been surprised, Sancho," said
Don Quixote, "if thou hadst not introduced some bit of a proverb into
thy speech. Well, well, I forgive thee, provided thou dost mend and
not show thyself in future so fond of thine own interest, but try to
be of good cheer and take heart, and encourage thyself to look forward
to the fulfillment of my promises, which, by being delayed, does not
become impossible." Sancho said he would do so, and keep up his heart
as best he could. They then entered the grove, and Don Quixote settled
himself at the foot of an elm, and Sancho at that of a beech, for
trees of this kind and others like them always have feet but no hands.
Sancho passed the night in pain, for with the evening dews the blow of
the staff made itself felt all the more. Don Quixote passed it in his
never-failing meditations; but, for all that, they had some winks of
sleep, and with the appearance of daylight they pursued their journey
in quest of the banks of the famous Ebro, where that befell them which
will be told in the following chapter. CHAPTER XXII. OF THE FREEDOM
DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO AGAINST THEIR WILL
WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO Cide Hamete Benengeli,
the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this most grave,
high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that after the
discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha and his squire
Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one, Don
Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was
travelling six pilgrims with staves, foreigners of that sort that beg
for alms singing; who as they drew near arranged themselves in a line
and lifting up their voices all together began to sing in their own
language something that Sancho could not with the exception of one
word which sounded plainly "alms," from which he gathered that it was
alms they asked for in their song; and being, as Cide Hamete says,
remarkably charitable, he took out of his alforias the half loaf and
half cheese he had been provided with, and gave them to them,
explaining to them by signs that he had nothing else to give them.
They received them very gladly, but exclaimed, "Geld! Geld!" "I don't
understand what you want of me, good people," said Sancho. On this one
of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it to Sancho, by
which he comprehended they were asking for money, and putting his
thumb to his throat and spreading his hand upwards he gave them to
understand that he had not the sign of a coin about him, and urging
Dapple forward he broke through them. But as he was passing, one of
them who had been examining him very closely rushed towards him, and
flinging his arms round him exclaimed in a loud voice and good
Spanish, "God bless me! What's this I see? Is it possible that I hold
in my arms my dear friend, my good neighbour Sancho Panza? But there's
no doubt about it, for I'm not asleep, nor am I drunk just now."
Sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find
himself embraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him
steadily without speaking he was still unable to recognise him; but
the pilgrim perceiving his perplexity cried, "What! and is it
possible, Sancho Panza, that thou dost not know thy neighbour Ricote,
the Morisco shopkeeper of thy village?" Sancho upon this looking at
him more carefully began to recall his features, and at last
recognised him perfectly, and without getting off the ass threw his
arms round his neck saying, "Who the devil could have known thee,
Ricote, in this mummer's dress thou art in? Tell me, who bas
frenchified thee, and how dost thou dare to return to Spain, where if
they catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough with thee?"
"If thou dost not betray me, Sancho," said the pilgrim, "I am safe;
for in this dress no one will recognise me; but let us turn aside out
of the road into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat
and rest, and thou shalt eat with them there, for they are very good
fellows; I'll have time enough to tell thee then all that has happened
me since I left our village in obedience to his Majesty's edict that
threatened such severities against the unfortunate people of my
nation, as thou hast heard." Sancho complied, and Ricote having spoken
to the other pilgrims they withdrew to the grove they saw, turning a
considerable distance out of the road. They threw down their staves,
took off their pilgrim's cloaks and remained in their under-clothing;
they were all good-looking young fellows, except Ricote, who was a man
somewhat advanced in years. They carried alforjas all of them, and all
apparently well filled, at least with things provocative of thirst,
such as would summon it from two leagues off. They stretched
themselves on the ground, and making a tablecloth of the grass they
spread upon it bread, salt, knives, walnut, scraps of cheese, and
well-picked ham-bones which if they were past gnawing were not past
sucking. They also put down a black dainty called, they say, caviar,
and made of the eggs of fish, a great thirst-wakener. Nor was there
any lack of olives, dry, it is true, and without any seasoning, but
for all that toothsome and pleasant. But what made the best show in
the field of the banquet was half a dozen botas of wine, for each of
them produced his own from his alforjas; even the good Ricote, who
from a Morisco had transformed himself into a German or Dutchman, took
out his, which in size might have vied with the five others. They then
began to eat with very great relish and very leisurely, making the
most of each morsel--very small ones of everything--they took up on
the point of the knife; and then all at the same moment raised their
arms and botas aloft, the mouths placed in their mouths, and all eyes
fixed on heaven just as if they were taking aim at it; and in this
attitude they remained ever so long, wagging their heads from side to
side as if in acknowledgment of the pleasure they were enjoying while
they decanted the bowels of the bottles into their own stomachs.
Sancho beheld all, "and nothing gave him pain;" so far from that,
acting on the proverb he knew so well, "when thou art at Rome do as
thou seest," he asked Ricote for his bota and took aim like the rest
of them, and with not less enjoyment. Four times did the botas bear
being uplifted, but the fifth it was all in vain, for they were drier
and more sapless than a rush by that time, which made the jollity that
had been kept up so far begin to flag. Every now and then some one of
them would grasp Sancho's right hand in his own saying, "Espanoli y
Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compano;" and Sancho would answer, "Bon
compano, jur a Di!" and then go off into a fit of laughter that lasted
an hour, without a thought for the moment of anything that had
befallen him in his government; for cares have very little sway over
us while we are eating and drinking. At length, the wine having come
to an end with them, drowsiness began to come over them, and they
dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth. Ricote and Sancho
alone remained awake, for they had eaten more and drunk less, and
Ricote drawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves at the foot of a
beech, leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and without once
falling into his own Morisco tongue Ricote spoke as follows in pure
Castilian: "Thou knowest well, neighbour and friend Sancho Panza, how
the proclamation or edict his Majesty commanded to be issued against
those of my nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least
it did, insomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting
Spain was out, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon
me and upon my children. I decided, then, and I think wisely (just
like one who knows that at a certain date the house he lives in will
be taken from him, and looks out beforehand for another to change
into), I decided, I say, to leave the town myself, alone and without
my family, and go to seek out some place to remove them to comfortably
and not in the hurried way in which the others took their departure;
for I saw very plainly, and so did all the older men among us, that
the proclamations were not mere threats, as some said, but positive
enactments which would be enforced at the appointed time; and what
made me believe this was what I knew of the base and extravagant
designs which our people harboured, designs of such a nature that I
think it was a divine inspiration that moved his Majesty to carry out
a resolution so spirited; not that we were all guilty, for some there
were true and steadfast Christians; but they were so few that they
could make no head against those who were not; and it was not prudent
to cherish a viper in the bosom by having enemies in the house. In
short it was with just cause that we were visited with the penalty of
banishment, a mild and lenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the
most terrible that could be inflicted upon us. Wherever we are we weep
for Spain; for after all we were born there and it is our natural
fatherland. Nowhere do we find the reception our unhappy condition
needs; and in Barbary and all the parts of Africa where we counted
upon being received, succoured, and welcomed, it is there they insult
and ill-treat us most. We knew not our good fortune until we lost it;
and such is the longing we almost all of us have to return to Spain,
that most of those who like myself know the language, and there are
many who do, come back to it and leave their wives and children
forsaken yonder, so great is their love for it; and now I know by
experience the meaning of the saying, sweet is the love of one's
country. "I left our village, as I said, and went to France, but
though they gave us a kind reception there I was anxious to see all I
could. I crossed into Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed
to me we might live with more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay
any attention to trifling points; everyone lives as he likes, for in
most parts they enjoy liberty of conscience. I took a house in a town
near Augsburg, and then joined these pilgrims, who are in the habit of
coming to Spain in great numbers every year to visit the shrines
there, which they look upon as their Indies and a sure and certain
source of gain. They travel nearly all over it, and there is no town
out of which they do not go full up of meat and drink, as the saying
is, and with a real, at least, in money, and they come off at the end
of their travels with more than a hundred crowns saved, which, changed
into gold, they smuggle out of the kingdom either in the hollow of
their staves or in the patches of their pilgrim's cloaks or by some
device of their own, and carry to their own country in spite of the
guards at the posts and passes where they are searched. Now my purpose
is, Sancho, to carry away the treasure that I left buried, which, as
it is outside the town, I shall be able to do without risk, and to
write, or cross over from Valencia, to my daughter and wife, who I
know are at Algiers, and find some means of bringing them to some
French port and thence to Germany, there to await what it may be God's
will to do with us; for, after all, Sancho, I know well that Ricota my
daughter and Francisca Ricota my wife are Catholic Christians, and
though I am not so much so, still I am more of a Christian than a
Moor, and it is always my prayer to God that he will open the eyes of
my understanding and show me how I am to begin to imitate you. I know
already that what he chiefly did was to pray and commend himself to
God; but what am I to do for a rosary, for I have not got one?" And
then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was by tearing
a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, and making
eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served him for
a rosary all the time he was there, during which he repeated countless
ave-marias. But what distressed him greatly was not having another
hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from; and so he
solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow, and writing
and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude
of verses all in harmony with his sadness, and some in praise of
Dulcinea; but, when he was found there afterwards, the only ones
completely legible that could be discovered were those that follow
here: Ye on the mountain side that grow, Ye green things all, trees,
shrubs, and bushes, Are ye aweary of the woe That this poor aching
bosom crushes? If it disturb you, and I owe Some reparation, it may be
a Defence for me to let you know Don Quixote's tears are on the flow,
And all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. The addition of "Del Toboso"
to Dulcinea's name gave rise to no little laughter among those who
found the above lines, for they suspected Don Quixote must have
fancied that unless he added "del Toboso" when he introduced the name
of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible; which was indeed the
fact, as he himself afterwards admitted. He wrote many more, but, as
has been said, these three verses were all that could be plainly and
perfectly deciphered. In this way, and in sighing and calling on the
fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams, and Echo,
moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear him, as well as in
looking for herbs to sustain him, he passed his time until Sancho's
return; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was three days,
the Knight of the Rueful Countenance would have worn such an altered
countenance that the mother that bore him would not have known him;
lean, yellow, with his eyes sunk deep in the cells of his skull; so
that to bring him round again, ever so little, cost me more than six
hundred eggs, as God knows, and all the world, and my hens too, that
won't let me tell a lie." "That I can well believe," replied the
bachelor, "for they are so good and so fat, and so well-bred, that
they would not say one thing for another, though they were to burst
for it. In short then, mistress housekeeper, that is all, and there is
nothing the matter, except what it is feared Don Quixote may do?" "No,
senor," said she. "Well then," returned the bachelor, "don't be
uneasy, but go home in peace; get me ready something hot for
breakfast, and while you are on the way say the prayer of Santa
Apollonia, that is if you know it; for I will come presently and you
will see miracles." "Woe is me," cried the housekeeper, "is it the
prayer of Santa Apollonia you would have me say? That would do if it
was the toothache my master had; but it is in the brains, what he has
got." "I know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don't
set yourself to argue with me, for you know I am a bachelor of
Salamanca, and one can't be more of a bachelor than that," replied
Carrasco; and with this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went
to look for the curate, and arrange with him what will be told in its
proper place. While Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they
had a discussion which the history records with great precision and
scrupulous exactness. Sancho said to his master, "Senor, I have educed
my wife to let me go with your worship wherever you choose to take
me." "Induced, you should say, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "not
educed." "Once or twice, as well as I remember," replied Sancho, "I
have begged of your worship not to mend my words, if so be as you
understand what I mean by them; and if you don't understand them to
say 'Sancho,' or 'devil,' 'I don't understand thee; and if I don't
make my meaning plain, then you may correct me, for I am so focile-"
"I don't understand thee, Sancho," said Don Quixote at once; "for I
know not what 'I am so focile' means." "'So focile' means I am so much
that way," replied Sancho. "I understand thee still less now," said
Don Quixote. "Well, if you can't understand me," said Sancho, "I don't
know how to put it; I know no more, God help me." "Oh, now I have hit
it," said Don Quixote; "thou wouldst say thou art so docile,
tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what I say to thee, and
submit to what I teach thee." "I would bet," said Sancho, "that from
the very first you understood me, and knew what I meant, but you
wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of
dozen blunders." "May be so," replied Don Quixote; "but to come to the
point, what does Teresa say?" "Teresa says," replied Sancho, "that I
should make sure with your worship, and 'let papers speak and beards
be still,' for 'he who binds does not wrangle,' since one 'take' is
better than two 'I'll give thee's;' and I say a woman's advice is no
great thing, and he who won't take it is a fool." "And so say I," said
Don Quixote; "continue, Sancho my friend; go on; you talk pearls
to-day." "The fact is," continued Sancho, "that, as your worship knows
better than I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are,
and to-morrow we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and
nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than God
may be pleased to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to
knock at our life's door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers,
nor struggles, nor sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common
talk and report say, and as they tell us from the pulpits every day."
"All that is very true," said Don Quixote; "but I cannot make out what
thou art driving at." "What I am driving at," said Sancho, "is that
your worship settle some fixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while
I am in your service, and that the same he paid me out of your estate;
for I don't care to stand on rewards which either come late, or ill,
or never at all; God help me with my own. In short, I would like to
know what I am to get, be it much or little; for the hen will lay on
one egg, and many littles make a much, and so long as one gains
something there is nothing lost. To be sure, if it should happen (what
I neither believe nor expect) that your worship were to give me that
island you have promised me, I am not so ungrateful nor so grasping
but that I would be willing to have the revenue of such island valued
and stopped out of my wages in due promotion." "Sancho, my friend,"
replied Don Quixote, "sometimes proportion may be as good as
promotion." "I see," said Sancho; "I'll bet I ought to have said
proportion, and not promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship
has understood me." "And so well understood," returned Don Quixote,
"that I have seen into the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark
thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look
here, Sancho, I would readily fix thy wages if I had ever found any
instance in the histories of the knights-errant to show or indicate,
by the slightest hint, what their squires used to get monthly or
yearly; but I have read all or the best part of their histories, and I
cannot remember reading of any knight-errant having assigned fixed
wages to his squire; I only know that they all served on reward, and
that when they least expected it, if good luck attended their masters,
they found themselves recompensed with an island or something
equivalent to it, or at the least they were left with a title and
lordship. If with these hopes and additional inducements you, Sancho,
please to return to my service, well and good; but to suppose that I
am going to travel on foot, and make long ones, is to suppose
nonsense." "Thou sayest well, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "let my
armour be hung up for a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve
on the trees what was inscribed on the trophy of Roland's armour--
These let none move Who dareth not his might with Roland prove."
"That's the very thing," said Sancho; "and if it was not that we
should feel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would be as well to
leave him hung up too." "And yet, I had rather not have either him or
the armour hung up," said Don Quixote, "that it may not be said, 'for
good service a bad return.'" "Your worship is right," said Sancho;
"for, as sensible people hold, 'the fault of the ass must not be laid
on the pack-saddle;' and, as in this affair the fault is your
worship's, punish yourself and don't let your anger break out against
the already battered and bloody armour, or the meekness of Rocinante,
or the tenderness of my feet, trying to make them travel more than is
reasonable." In converse of this sort the whole of that day went by,
as did the four succeeding ones, without anything occurring to
interrupt their journey, but on the fifth as they entered a village
they found a great number of people at the door of an inn enjoying
themselves, as it was a holiday. Upon Don Quixote's approach a peasant
called out, "One of these two gentlemen who come here, and who don't
know the parties, will tell us what we ought to do about our wager."
"That I will, certainly," said Don Quixote, "and according to the
rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it." "Well, here it
is, worthy sir," said the peasant; "a man of this village who is so
fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a neighbour of
his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. The agreement
was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with equal
weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were to be
equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone, should put
eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty stone of
the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one." "Not at
all," exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could answer; "it's
for me, that only a few days ago left off being a governor and a
judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful questions and
give an opinion in disputes of all sorts." "Answer in God's name,
Sancho my friend," said Don Quixote, "for I will now make the precious
balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an eye."
By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and
came in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho
caught sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with
a cloth on his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding
countenance, he said to his master, "Senor, can it be that this is the
enchanted Moor coming back to give us more castigation if there be
anything still left in the ink-bottle?" "It cannot be the Moor,"
answered Don Quixote, "for those under enchantment do not let
themselves be seen by anyone." "If they don't let themselves be seen,
they let themselves be felt," said Sancho; "if not, let my shoulders
speak to the point." "Mine could speak too," said Don Quixote, "but
that is not a sufficient reason for believing that what we see is the
enchanted Moor." The officer came up, and finding them engaged in such
a peaceful conversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure,
still lay on his back unable to move from pure pummelling and
plasters. The officer turned to him and said, "Well, how goes it, good
man?" "I would speak more politely if I were you," replied Don
Quixote; "is it the way of this country to address knights-errant in
that style, you booby?" The cuadrillero finding himself so
disrespectfully treated by such a sorry-looking individual, lost his
temper, and raising the lamp full of oil, smote Don Quixote such a
blow with it on the head that he gave him a badly broken pate; then,
all being in darkness, he went out, and Sancho Panza said, "That is
certainly the enchanted Moor, Senor, and he keeps the treasure for
others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks." "That is the
truth," answered Don Quixote, "and there is no use in troubling
oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or vexed at
them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no one on
whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou canst,
and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a little
oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam, for
indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing much
blood from the wound that phantom gave me." Sancho got up with pain
enough in his bones, and went after the innkeeper in the dark, and
meeting the officer, who was looking to see what had become of his
enemy, he said to him, "Senor, whoever you are, do us the favour and
kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt, and wine, for it is
wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on earth, who lies on
yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted Moor that is in this
inn." When the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a
man out of his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he
opened the inn gate, and calling the host, he told him what this good
man wanted. The host furnished him with what he required, and Sancho
brought it to Don Quixote, who, with his hand to his head, was
bewailing the pain of the blow of the lamp, which had done him no more
harm than raising a couple of rather large lumps, and what he fancied
blood was only the sweat that flowed from him in his sufferings during
the late storm. To be brief, he took the materials, of which he made a
compound, mixing them all and boiling them a good while until it
seemed to him they had come to perfection. He then asked for some vial
to pour it into, and as there was not one in the inn, he decided on
putting it into a tin oil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a
free gift; and over the flask he repeated more than eighty
paternosters and as many more ave-marias, salves, and credos,
accompanying each word with a cross by way of benediction, at all
which there were present Sancho, the innkeeper, and the cuadrillero;
for the carrier was now peacefully engaged in attending to the comfort
of his mules. This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial
himself, on the spot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he
considered it, and so he drank near a quart of what could not be put
into the flask and remained in the pigskin in which it had been
boiled; but scarcely had he done drinking when he began to vomit in
such a way that nothing was left in his stomach, and with the pangs
and spasms of vomiting he broke into a profuse sweat, on account of
which he bade them cover him up and leave him alone. They did so, and
he lay sleeping more than three hours, at the end of which he was
left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he could not
stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt himself
relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in quest of
adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered there
was a fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his
help and protection, all the more when he had the security and
confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he
saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on his squire's
beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass; after which
he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn he laid hold
of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance. All that
were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood watching
him; the innkeeper's daughter was likewise observing him, and he too
never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched a sigh that
he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they all
thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate they
who had seen him plastered the night before thought so. As soon as
they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to the host
and said in a very grave and measured voice, "Many and great are the
favours, Senor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of yours,
and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for
them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you of
any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is no
other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to
chastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this
kind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of
knighthood which I have received, and by my vocation of knight-errant,
if you gratify me in this, to serve you with all the zeal my calling
demands of me, either in relieving your misfortune if it admits of
relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as I promised to do." The
Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk in
this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again, and
again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly
examined him, he said to him: "If you have anything to give me to eat,
for God's sake give it me, and after I have eaten I will do all you
ask in acknowledgment of the goodwill you have displayed towards me."
Sancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished the
Ragged One with the means of appeasing his hunger, and what they gave
him he ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no time
between mouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ate
neither he nor they who observed him uttered a word. As soon as he had
done he made signs to them to follow him, which they did, and he led
them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner
of a rock. On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the
others did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One,
settling himself in his place, said: "If it is your wish, sirs, that I
should disclose in a few words the surpassing extent of my
misfortunes, you must promise not to break the thread of my sad story
with any question or other interruption, for the instant you do so the
tale I tell will come to an end." These words of the Ragged One
reminded Don Quixote of the tale his squire had told him, when he
failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed the river and the
story remained unfinished; but to return to the Ragged One, he went on
to say: "I give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over
the story of my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves
to add fresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I
make an end of the recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything
of importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity." Don Quixote
gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this assurance
he began as follows: "My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the
best cities of this Andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my
misfortune so great that my parents must have wept and my family
grieved over it without being able by their wealth to lighten it; for
the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven.
In that same country there was a heaven in which love had placed all
the glory I could desire; such was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as
noble and as rich as I, but of happier fortunes, and of less firmness
than was due to so worthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I loved,
worshipped, and adored from my earliest and tenderest years, and she
loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood. Our parents
were aware of our feelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for
they saw clearly that as they ripened they must lead at last to a
marriage between us, a thing that seemed almost prearranged by the
equality of our families and wealth. We grew up, and with our growth
grew the love between us, so that the father of Luscinda felt bound
for propriety's sake to refuse me admission to his house, in this
perhaps imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated by the
poets, and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame; for
though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it
upon our pens, which can make known the heart's secrets to a loved one
more freely than tongues; for many a time the presence of the object
of love shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue.
Ah heavens! how many letters did I write her, and how many dainty
modest replies did I receive! how many ditties and love-songs did I
compose in which my heart declared and made known its feelings,
described its ardent longings, revelled in its recollections and
dallied with its desires! At length growing impatient and feeling my
heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to put into
execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of winning my
desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for my lawful
wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me for the
disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as
honoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was
alive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in
accordance with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be
taken or given by stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting
that there was reason in what he said, and that my father would assent
to it as soon as I should tell him, and with that view I went the very
same instant to let him know what my desires were. When I entered the
room where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand, which,
before I could utter a word, he gave me, saying, 'By this letter thou
wilt see, Cardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve
thee.' This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is a
grandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia.
I took and read the letter, which was couched in terms so flattering
that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply
with the request the duke made in it, which was that he would send me
immediately to him, as he wished me to become the companion, not
servant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge of
placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held
me. On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I
heard my father say, 'Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in
accordance with the duke's wish, and give thanks to God who is opening
a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost
deserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel. The
time for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told
her all that had occurred, as I did also to her father, entreating him
to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until I
should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise,
and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered. Finally, I
presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him so
kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants
growing envious of me, and regarding the duke's inclination to show me
favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave
the greatest pleasure was the duke's second son, Fernando by name, a
gallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very
soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by
everybody; for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me
kindness, he did not carry his affectionate treatment to the same
length as Don Fernando. It so happened, then, that as between friends
no secret remains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don
Fernando had grown into friendship, he made all his thoughts known to
me, and in particular a love affair which troubled his mind a little.
He was deeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his father's,
the daughter of wealthy parents, and herself so beautiful, modest,
discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her was able to decide in
which of these respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled.
The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando
to such a point that, in order to gain his object and overcome her
virtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge his word to her to
become her husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt
an impossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by the
best arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to
restrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I
produced no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father,
acquainted with the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and
shrewd, foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a
good servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed
to the honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me,
he told me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the
beauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months,
and that he wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of
us, to my father's house under the pretence, which he would make to
the duke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in
my city, which produces the best in the world. When I heard him say
so, even if his resolution had not been so good a one I should have
hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted by
my affection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it
offered me of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and wish
I commended his idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put it
into execution as quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence produced
its effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings. But, as
afterwards appeared, when he said this to me he had already enjoyed
the peasant girl under the title of husband, and was waiting for an
opportunity of making it known with safety to himself, being in dread
of what his father the duke would do when he came to know of his
folly. It happened, then, that as with young men love is for the most
part nothing more than appetite, which, as its final object is
enjoyment, comes to an end on obtaining it, and that which seemed to
be love takes to flight, as it cannot pass the limit fixed by nature,
which fixes no limit to true love--what I mean is that after Don
Fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and his
eagerness cooled, and if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself
in order to cure his love, he was now in reality anxious to go to
avoid keeping his promise. "The duke gave him permission, and ordered
me to accompany him; we arrived at my city, and my father gave him the
reception due to his rank; I saw Luscinda without delay, and, though
it had not been dead or deadened, my love gathered fresh life. To my
sorrow I told the story of it to Don Fernando, for I thought that in
virtue of the great friendship he bore me I was bound to conceal
nothing from him. I extolled her beauty, her gaiety, her wit, so
warmly, that my praises excited in him a desire to see a damsel
adorned by such attractions. To my misfortune I yielded to it, showing
her to him one night by the light of a taper at a window where we used
to talk to one another. As she appeared to him in her dressing-gown,
she drove all the beauties he had seen until then out of his
recollection; speech failed him, his head turned, he was spell-bound,
and in the end love-smitten, as you will see in the course of the
story of my misfortune; and to inflame still further his passion,
which he hid from me and revealed to Heaven alone, it so happened that
one day he found a note of hers entreating me to demand her of her
father in marriage, so delicate, so modest, and so tender, that on
reading it he told me that in Luscinda alone were combined all the
charms of beauty and understanding that were distributed among all the
other women in the world. It is true, and I own it now, that though I
knew what good cause Don Fernando had to praise Luscinda, it gave me
uneasiness to hear these praises from his mouth, and I began to fear,
and with reason to feel distrust of him, for there was no moment when
he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and he would start the subject
himself even though he dragged it in unseasonably, a circumstance that
aroused in me a certain amount of jealousy; not that I feared any
change in the constancy or faith of Luscinda; but still my fate led me
to forebode what she assured me against. Don Fernando contrived always
to read the letters I sent to Luscinda and her answers to me, under
the pretence that he enjoyed the wit and sense of both. It so
happened, then, that Luscinda having begged of me a book of chivalry
to read, one that she was very fond of, Amadis of Gaul-" Don Quixote
no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said: "Had your
worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady Luscinda
was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have been
requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding, for
it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for
such delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned,
you need waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and
intelligence; for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her
to be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world;
and I wish your worship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her the
worthy Don Rugel of Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly
relish Daraida and Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd
Darinel, and the admirable verses of his bucolics, sung and delivered
by him with such sprightliness, wit, and ease; but a time may come
when this omission can be remedied, and to rectify it nothing more is
needed than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my
village, for there I can give you more than three hundred books which
are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;--though
it occurs to me that I have not got one of them now, thanks to the
spite of wicked and envious enchanters;--but pardon me for having
broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when I
hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I can no more help talking
about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or those of
the moon moisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is more
to the purpose now." While Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio
allowed his head to fall upon his breast, and seemed plunged in deep
thought; and though twice Don Quixote bade him go on with his story,
he neither looked up nor uttered a word in reply; but after some time
he raised his head and said, "I cannot get rid of the idea, nor will
anyone in the world remove it, or make me think otherwise--and he
would be a blockhead who would hold or believe anything else than that
that arrant knave Master Elisabad made free with Queen Madasima."
"That is not true, by all that's good," said Don Quixote in high
wrath, turning upon him angrily, as his way was; "and it is a very
great slander, or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very
illustrious lady, and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a
princess would have made free with a quack; and whoever maintains the
contrary lies like a great scoundrel, and I will give him to know it,
on foot or on horseback, armed or unarmed, by night or by day, or as
he likes best." Cardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit
having now come upon him, he had no disposition to go on with his
story, nor would Don Quixote have listened to it, so much had what he
had heard about Madasima disgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up
for her as if she were in earnest his veritable born lady; to such a
pass had his unholy books brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I
said, now mad, when he heard himself given the lie, and called a
scoundrel and other insulting names, not relishing the jest, snatched
up a stone that he found near him, and with it delivered such a blow
on Don Quixote's breast that he laid him on his back. Sancho Panza,
seeing his master treated in this fashion, attacked the madman with
his closed fist; but the Ragged One received him in such a way that
with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet, and then
mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the
goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having
beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his
hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the rage he felt
at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take
vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them warning
that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known
it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves. The
goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heard
him, that was no fault of his. Sancho retorted, and the goatherd
rejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the
beard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made
peace between them, they would have knocked one another to pieces.
"Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance," said Sancho,
grappling with the goatherd, "for of this fellow, who is a clown like
myself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the
affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an
honest man." "That is true," said Don Quixote, "but I know that he is
not to blame for what has happened." With this he pacified them, and
again asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find Cardenio, as
he felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his story. The
goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that there was no
knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he wandered
about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in with him
either in or out of his senses. CHAPTER XXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE
STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF LA MANCHA IN THE
SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OF BELTENEBROS Don
Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting Rocinante
bade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very
discontentedly. They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most
rugged part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk
with his master, and longing for him to begin, so that there should be
no breach of the injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence
so long he said to him: "Senor Don Quixote, give me your worship's
blessing and dismissal, for I'd like to go home at once to my wife and
children with whom I can at any rate talk and converse as much as I
like; for to want me to go through these solitudes day and night and
not speak to you when I have a mind is burying me alive. If luck would
have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of Guisopete, it
would not be so bad, because I could talk to Rocinante about whatever
came into my head, and so put up with my ill-fortune; but it is a hard
case, and not to be borne with patience, to go seeking adventures all
one's life and get nothing but kicks and blanketings, brickbats and
punches, and with all this to have to sew up one's mouth without
daring to say what is in one's heart, just as if one were dumb." "I
understand thee, Sancho," replied Don Quixote; "I perceive clearly
that those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather
than in music." "It's sweet to us all, blessed be God," said Sancho.
"I do not deny it," replied Don Quixote; "but settle thyself where
thou wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in
watching than in sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to
dress this ear for me again, for it is giving me more pain than it
need." Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the
wound, told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with
which it would be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary,
of which there was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed
them with a little salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them
firmly with a bandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be
required, and so it proved. CHAPTER XII. OF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO
THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTE Just then another young man, one of those who
fetched their provisions from the village, came up and said, "Do you
know what is going on in the village, comrades?" "How could we know
it?" replied one of them. "Well, then, you must know," continued the
young man, "this morning that famous student-shepherd called
Chrysostom died, and it is rumoured that he died of love for that
devil of a village girl the daughter of Guillermo the Rich, she that
wanders about the wolds here in the dress of a shepherdess." "You mean
Marcela?" said one. "Her I mean," answered the goatherd; "and the best
of it is, he has directed in his will that he is to be buried in the
fields like a Moor, and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree
spring is, because, as the story goes (and they say he himself said
so), that was the place where he first saw her. And he has also left
other directions which the clergy of the village say should not and
must not be obeyed because they savour of paganism. To all which his
great friend Ambrosio the student, he who, like him, also went dressed
as a shepherd, replies that everything must be done without any
omission according to the directions left by Chrysostom, and about
this the village is all in commotion; however, report says that, after
all, what Ambrosio and all the shepherds his friends desire will be
done, and to-morrow they are coming to bury him with great ceremony
where I said. I am sure it will be something worth seeing; at least I
will not fail to go and see it even if I knew I should not return to
the village tomorrow." "We will do the same," answered the goatherds,
"and cast lots to see who must stay to mind the goats of all." "Thou
sayest well, Pedro," said one, "though there will be no need of taking
that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don't suppose it is
virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter that ran
into my foot the other day will not let me walk." "For all that, we
thank thee," answered Pedro. Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who
the dead man was and who the shepherdess, to which Pedro replied that
all he knew was that the dead man was a wealthy gentleman belonging to
a village in those mountains, who had been a student at Salamanca for
many years, at the end of which he returned to his village with the
reputation of being very learned and deeply read. "Above all, they
said, he was learned in the science of the stars and of what went on
yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon, for he told us of the
cris of the sun and moon to exact time." "Eclipse it is called,
friend, not cris, the darkening of those two luminaries," said Don
Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with trifles, went on with
his story, saying, "Also he foretold when the year was going to be one
of abundance or estility." "Sterility, you mean," said Don Quixote.
"Sterility or estility," answered Pedro, "it is all the same in the
end. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who
believed him grew very rich because they did as he advised them,
bidding them 'sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow
pulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and the
three following not a drop will be got.'" "That science is called
astrology," said Don Quixote. "I do not know what it is called,"
replied Pedro, "but I know that he knew all this and more besides.
But, to make an end, not many months had passed after he returned from
Salamanca, when one day he appeared dressed as a shepherd with his
crook and sheepskin, having put off the long gown he wore as a
scholar; and at the same time his great friend, Ambrosio by name, who
had been his companion in his studies, took to the shepherd's dress
with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is dead, was a great
man for writing verses, so much so that he made carols for Christmas
Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young men of our village
acted, and all said they were excellent. When the villagers saw the
two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd's dress, they were
lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them to make so
extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our Chrysostom
died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels
as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a large
sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute owner,
and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very good comrade,
and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a countenance
like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that he had changed
his dress with no other object than to wander about these wastes after
that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago, with whom the
deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell you now, for
it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps, and even
without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it all the
days of your life, though you should live more years than sarna." "Say
Sarra," said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd's confusion of
words. "The sarna lives long enough," answered Pedro; "and if, senor,
you must go finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make
an end of it this twelvemonth." "Pardon me, friend," said Don Quixote;
"but, as there is such a difference between sarna and Sarra, I told
you of it; however, you have answered very rightly, for sarna lives
longer than Sarra: so continue your story, and I will not object any
more to anything." "I say then, my dear sir," said the goatherd, "that
in our village there was a farmer even richer than the father of
Chrysostom, who was named Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over
and above great wealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the
most respected woman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can
see her now with that countenance which had the sun on one side and
the moon on the other; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for
which I trust that at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God
in the other world. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death
of so good a wife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to
the care of an uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village.
The girl grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother's,
which was very great, and yet it was thought that the daughter's would
exceed it; and so when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen
years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had made her so
beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her past
redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement, but
for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for
it as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and
importuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but
of those many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in
them. But he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give
her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to
do so without her consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and
profit which the custody of the girl's property brought him while he
put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good
priest in more than one set in the town. For I would have you know,
Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is talked about
and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am, that the
priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to
speak well of him, especially in villages." "That is the truth," said
Don Quixote; "but go on, for the story is very good, and you, good
Pedro, tell it with very good grace." "May that of the Lord not be
wanting to me," said Pedro; "that is the one to have. To proceed; you
must know that though the uncle put before his niece and described to
her the qualities of each one in particular of the many who had asked
her in marriage, begging her to marry and make a choice according to
her own taste, she never gave any other answer than that she had no
desire to marry just yet, and that being so young she did not think
herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At these, to all
appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle ceased to urge
her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could
mate herself to her own liking. For, said he--and he said quite
right--parents are not to settle children in life against their will.
But when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day the demure
Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite of her
uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her, took to
going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village, and
tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, and her
beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how many rich
youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume of
Chrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of
these, as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they
say that he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose,
because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of
so little or rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or
even the semblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and
modesty; on the contrary, such and so great is the vigilance with
which she watches over her honour, that of all those that court and
woo her not one has boasted, or can with truth boast, that she has
given him any hope however small of obtaining his desire. For although
she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the
shepherds, and treats them courteously and kindly, should any one of
them come to declare his intention to her, though it be one as proper
and holy as that of matrimony, she flings him from her like a
catapult. And with this kind of disposition she does more harm in this
country than if the plague had got into it, for her affability and her
beauty draw on the hearts of those that associate with her to love her
and to court her, but her scorn and her frankness bring them to the
brink of despair; and so they know not what to say save to proclaim
her aloud cruel and hard-hearted, and other names of the same sort
which well describe the nature of her character; and if you should
remain here any time, senor, you would hear these hills and valleys
resounding with the laments of the rejected ones who pursue her. Not
far from this there is a spot where there are a couple of dozen of
tall beeches, and there is not one of them but has carved and written
on its smooth bark the name of Marcela, and above some a crown carved
on the same tree as though her lover would say more plainly that
Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty. Here one shepherd
is sighing, there another is lamenting; there love songs are heard,
here despairing elegies. One will pass all the hours of the night
seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there, without having
closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the morning bemused and
bereft of sense; and another without relief or respite to his sighs,
stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer
noontide, makes his appeal to the compassionate heavens, and over one
and the other, over these and all, the beautiful Marcela triumphs free
and careless. And all of us that know her are waiting to see what her
pride will come to, and who is to be the happy man that will succeed
in taming a nature so formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so
supreme. All that I have told you being such well-established truth, I
am persuaded that what they say of the cause of Chrysostom's death, as
our lad told us, is the same. And so I advise you, senor, fail not to
be present to-morrow at his burial, which will be well worth seeing,
for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is not half a league from this
place to where he directed he should be buried." "I will make a point
of it," said Don Quixote, "and I thank you for the pleasure you have
given me by relating so interesting a tale." "Oh," said the goatherd,
"I do not know even the half of what has happened to the lovers of
Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in with some shepherd on
the road who can tell us; and now it will be well for you to go and
sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your wound, though with
the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of an untoward
result." Sancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd's loquacity at the
devil, on his part begged his master to go into Pedro's hut to sleep.
He did so, and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his
lady Dulcinea, in imitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza
settled himself between Rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a
lover who had been discarded, but like a man who had been soundly
kicked. CHAPTER XIII. IN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS
MARCELA, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS Bit hardly had day begun to show itself
through the balconies of the east, when five of the six goatherds came
to rouse Don Quixote and tell him that if he was still of a mind to go
and see the famous burial of Chrysostom they would bear him company.
Don Quixote, who desired nothing better, rose and ordered Sancho to
saddle and pannel at once, which he did with all despatch, and with
the same they all set out forthwith. They had not gone a quarter of a
league when at the meeting of two paths they saw coming towards them
some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins and with their heads
crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter oleander. Each of them
carried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along with them there
came two men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress,
with three servants on foot accompanying them. Courteous salutations
were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring one of the other which way
each party was going, they learned that all were bound for the scene
of the burial, so they went on all together. One of those on horseback
addressing his companion said to him, "It seems to me, Senor
Knight-errant, that your worship has made choice of one of the most
austere professions in the world, and I imagine even that of the
Carthusian monks is not so austere." "As austere it may perhaps be,"
replied our Don Quixote, "but so necessary for the world I am very
much inclined to doubt. For, if the truth is to be told, I like them
both; though I have never seen the lady Dulcinea." "How! never seen
her, blasphemous traitor!" exclaimed Don Quixote; "hast thou not just
now brought me a message from her?" "I mean," said Sancho, "that I did
not see her so much at my leisure that I could take particular notice
of her beauty, or of her charms piecemeal; but taken in the lump I
like her." "Now I forgive thee," said Don Quixote; "and do thou
forgive me the injury I have done thee; for our first impulses are not
in our control." "That I see," replied Sancho, "and with me the wish
to speak is always the first impulse, and I cannot help saying, once
at any rate, what I have on the tip of my tongue." "For all that,
Sancho," said Don Quixote, "take heed of what thou sayest, for the
pitcher goes so often to the well--I need say no more to thee." "Well,
well," said Sancho, "God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and will
judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worship in
not doing it." "That is enough," said Dorothea; "run, Sancho, and kiss
your lord's hand and beg his pardon, and henceforward be more
circumspect with your praise and abuse; and say nothing in
disparagement of that lady Toboso, of whom I know nothing save that I
am her servant; and put your trust in God, for you will not fail to
obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince." Sancho advanced
hanging his head and begged his master's hand, which Don Quixote with
dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as soon as he had
kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he had questions
to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him. Sancho
obeyed, and when the two had gone some distance in advance Don Quixote
said to him, "Since thy return I have had no opportunity or time to
ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou
hast brought back, and now that chance has granted us the time and
opportunity, deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good
news." "Let your worship ask what you will," answered Sancho, "for I
shall find a way out of all as as I found a way in; but I implore you,
senor, not not to be so revengeful in future." "Why dost thou say
that, Sancho?" said Don Quixote. "I say it," he returned, "because
those blows just now were more because of the quarrel the devil
stirred up between us both the other night, than for what I said
against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and reverence as I would a
relic--though there is nothing of that about her--merely as something
belonging to your worship." "Say no more on that subject for thy life,
Sancho," said Don Quixote, "for it is displeasing to me; I have
already pardoned thee for that, and thou knowest the common saying,
'for a fresh sin a fresh penance.'" While this was going on they saw
coming along the road they were following a man mounted on an ass, who
when he came close seemed to be a gipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes
and heart were there wherever he saw asses, no sooner beheld the man
than he knew him to be Gines de Pasamonte; and by the thread of the
gipsy he got at the ball, his ass, for it was, in fact, Dapple that
carried Pasamonte, who to escape recognition and to sell the ass had
disguised himself as a gipsy, being able to speak the gipsy language,
and many more, as well as if they were his own. Sancho saw him and
recognised him, and the instant he did so he shouted to him,
"Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure, release my life, embarrass
thyself not with my repose, quit my ass, leave my delight, be off,
rip, get thee gone, thief, and give up what is not thine." There was
no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the first one
Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and got clear
of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him he said,
"How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my comrade?" all
the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a human being.
The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and caressed by
Sancho without answering a single word. They all came up and
congratulated him on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially, who
told him that notwithstanding this he would not cancel the order for
the three ass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him. While the two had
been going along conversing in this fashion, the curate observed to
Dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, as well in the story
itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it bore to those of
the books of chivalry. She said that she had many times amused herself
reading them; but that she did not know the situation of the provinces
or seaports, and so she had said at haphazard that she had landed at
Osuna. "So I saw," said the curate, "and for that reason I made haste
to say what I did, by which it was all set right. But is it not a
strange thing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all
these figments and lies, simply because they are in the style and
manner of the absurdities of his books?" "So it is," said Cardenio;
"and so uncommon and unexampled, that were one to attempt to invent
and concoct it in fiction, I doubt if there be any wit keen enough to
imagine it." "But another strange thing about it," said the curate,
"is that, apart from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says
in connection with his craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he
can discuss them in a perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind
is quite clear and composed; so that, provided his chivalry is not
touched upon, no one would take him to be anything but a man of
thoroughly sound understanding." While they were holding this
conversation Don Quixote continued his with Sancho, saying: "Friend
Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell me now,
dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst thou find
Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her? What did she
answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter? Who copied it
out for thee? and everything in the matter that seems to thee worth
knowing, asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying to give
me pleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of it."
"Senor," replied Sancho, "if the truth is to be told, nobody copied
out the letter for me, for I carried no letter at all." "It is as thou
sayest," said Don Quixote, "for the note-book in which I wrote it I
found in my own possession two days after thy departure, which gave me
very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do on finding
thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst return from
the place where thou didst first miss it." "So I should have done,"
said Sancho, "if I had not got it by heart when your worship read it
to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan, who copied it out for me
from hearing it, so exactly that he said in all the days of his life,
though he had read many a letter of excommunication, he had never seen
or read so pretty a letter as that." "And hast thou got it still in
thy memory, Sancho?" said Don Quixote. "No, senor," replied Sancho,
"for as soon as I had repeated it, seeing there was no further use for
it, I set about forgetting it; and if I recollect any of it, it is
that about 'Scrubbing,'I mean to say 'Sovereign Lady,' and the end
'Yours till death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance." It gave them
no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good memory Sancho
had, and they complimented him greatly upon it, and begged him to
repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they too might get
it by heart to write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it three times,
and as he did, uttered three thousand more absurdities; then he told
them more about his master but he never said a word about the
blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn, into which he
refused to enter. He told them, moreover, how his lord, if he brought
him a favourable answer from the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to put
himself in the way of endeavouring to become an emperor, or at least a
monarch; for it had been so settled between them, and with his
personal worth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to come
to be one: and how on becoming one his lord was to make a marriage for
him (for he would be a widower by that time, as a matter of course)
and was to give him as a wife one of the damsels of the empress, the
heiress of some rich and grand state on the mainland, having nothing
to do with islands of any sort, for he did not care for them now. All
this Sancho delivered with so much composure--wiping his nose from
time to time--and with so little common-sense that his two hearers
were again filled with wonder at the force of Don Quixote's madness
that could run away with this poor man's reason. They did not care to
take the trouble of disabusing him of his error, as they considered
that since it did not in any way hurt his conscience it would be
better to leave him in it, and they would have all the more amusement
in listening to his simplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for
his lord's health, as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing
for him in course of time to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at
least an archbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank. To which
Sancho made answer, "If fortune, sirs, should bring things about in
such a way that my master should have a mind, instead of being an
emperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know what
archbishops-errant commonly give their squires?" "They commonly give
them," said the curate, some simple benefice or cure, or some place as
sacristan which brings them a good fixed income, not counting the
altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more." "But for that,"
said Sancho, "the squire must be unmarried, and must know, at any
rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me, for I am
married already and I don't know the first letter of the A B C. What
will become of me if my master takes a fancy to be an archbishop and
not an emperor, as is usual and customary with knights-errant?" "Be
not uneasy, friend Sancho," said the barber, "for we will entreat your
master, and advise him, even urging it upon him as a case of
conscience, to become an emperor and not an archbishop, because it
will be easier for him as he is more valiant than lettered." "So I
have thought," said Sancho; "though I can tell you he is fit for
anything: what I mean to do for my part is to pray to our Lord to
place him where it may be best for him, and where he may be able to
bestow most favours upon me." "You speak like a man of sense," said
the curate, "and you will be acting like a good Christian; but what
must now be done is to take steps to coax your master out of that
useless penance you say he is performing; and we had best turn into
this inn to consider what plan to adopt, and also to dine, for it is
now time." Sancho said they might go in, but that he would wait there
outside, and that he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was
unwilling, and why it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them
to bring him out something to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to
bring barley for Rocinante. They left him and went in, and presently
the barber brought him out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had
between them carefully thought over what they should do to carry out
their object, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour
Don Quixote, and effect their purpose; and his notion, which he
explained to the barber, was that he himself should assume the
disguise of a wandering damsel, while the other should try as best he
could to pass for a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where
Don Quixote was, and he, pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed
damsel, should ask a favour of him, which as a valiant knight-errant
he could not refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was
that he should accompany her whither she would conduct him, in order
to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done her, while at the
same time she should entreat him not to require her to remove her
mask, nor ask her any question touching her circumstances until he had
righted her with the wicked knight. And he had no doubt that Don
Quixote would comply with any request made in these terms, and that in
this way they might remove him and take him to his own village, where
they would endeavour to find out if his extraordinary madness admitted
of any kind of remedy. CHAPTER XXVII. OF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER
PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF
RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY The curate's plan did not seem a bad one
to the barber, but on the contrary so good that they immediately set
about putting it in execution. They begged a petticoat and hood of the
landlady, leaving her in pledge a new cassock of the curate's; and the
barber made a beard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the
landlord used to stick his comb. The landlady asked them what they
wanted these things for, and the curate told her in a few words about
the madness of Don Quixote, and how this disguise was intended to get
him away from the mountain where he then was. The landlord and
landlady immediately came to the conclusion that the madman was their
guest, the balsam man and master of the blanketed squire, and they
told the curate all that had passed between him and them, not omitting
what Sancho had been so silent about. Finally the landlady dressed up
the curate in a style that left nothing to be desired; she put on him
a cloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed,
and a bodice of green velvet set off by a binding of white satin,
which as well as the petticoat must have been made in the time of king
Wamba. The curate would not let them hood him, but put on his head a
little quilted linen cap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his
forehead with a strip of black silk, while with another he made a mask
with which he concealed his beard and face very well. He then put on
his hat, which was broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and
enveloping himself in his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his
mule, while the barber mounted his with a beard down to the waist of
mingled red and white, for it was, as has been said, the tail of a
clay-red ox. They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who,
sinner as she was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might
grant them success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as
that they had in hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn
when it struck the curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself
out in that fashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to
dress himself that way even though much might depend upon it; and
saying so to the barber he begged him to change dresses, as it was
fitter he should be the distressed damsel, while he himself would play
the squire's part, which would be less derogatory to his dignity;
otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more to do with the matter,
and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came
up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he was unable to restrain
his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished,
and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct him how to
play his part and what to say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him
to come with them and give up his fancy for the place he had chosen
for his idle penance. The barber told him he could manage it properly
without any instruction, and as he did not care to dress himself up
until they were near where Don Quixote was, he folded up the garments,
and the curate adjusted his beard, and they set out under the guidance
of Sancho Panza, who went along telling them of the encounter with the
madman they met in the Sierra, saying nothing, however, about the
finding of the valise and its contents; for with all his simplicity
the lad was a trifle covetous. The next day they reached the place
where Sancho had laid the broom-branches as marks to direct him to
where he had left his master, and recognising it he told them that
here was the entrance, and that they would do well to dress
themselves, if that was required to deliver his master; for they had
already told him that going in this guise and dressing in this way
were of the highest importance in order to rescue his master from the
pernicious life he had adopted; and they charged him strictly not to
tell his master who they were, or that he knew them, and should he
ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter to Dulcinea, to say
that he had, and that, as she did not know how to read, she had given
an answer by word of mouth, saying that she commanded him, on pain of
her displeasure, to come and see her at once; and it was a very
important matter for himself, because in this way and with what they
meant to say to him they felt sure of bringing him back to a better
mode of life and inducing him to take immediate steps to become an
emperor or monarch, for there was no fear of his becoming an
archbishop. All this Sancho listened to and fixed it well in his
memory, and thanked them heartily for intending to recommend his
master to be an emperor instead of an archbishop, for he felt sure
that in the way of bestowing rewards on their squires emperors could
do more than archbishops-errant. He said, too, that it would be as
well for him to go on before them to find him, and give him his lady's
answer; for that perhaps might be enough to bring him away from the
place without putting them to all this trouble. They approved of what
Sancho proposed, and resolved to wait for him until he brought back
word of having found his master. Sancho pushed on into the glens of
the Sierra, leaving them in one through which there flowed a little
gentle rivulet, and where the rocks and trees afforded a cool and
grateful shade. It was an August day with all the heat of one, and the
heat in those parts is intense, and the hour was three in the
afternoon, all which made the spot the more inviting and tempted them
to wait there for Sancho's return, which they did. They were reposing,
then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied by the notes of any
instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone, reached their ears, at
which they were not a little astonished, as the place did not seem to
them likely quarters for one who sang so well; for though it is often
said that shepherds of rare voice are to be found in the woods and
fields, this is rather a flight of the poet's fancy than the truth.
And still more surprised were they when they perceived that what they
heard sung were the verses not of rustic shepherds, but of the
polished wits of the city; and so it proved, for the verses they heard
were these: What makes my quest of happiness seem vain? Disdain. What
bids me to abandon hope of ease? Jealousies. What holds my heart in
anguish of suspense? Absence. If that be so, then for my grief Where
shall I turn to seek relief, When hope on every side lies slain By
Absence, Jealousies, Disdain? What the prime cause of all my woe doth
prove? Love. What at my glory ever looks askance? Chance. Whence is
permission to afflict me given? Heaven. If that be so, I but await The
stroke of a resistless fate, Since, working for my woe, these three,
Love, Chance and Heaven, in league I see. What must I do to find a
remedy? Die. What is the lure for love when coy and strange? Change.
What, if all fail, will cure the heart of sadness? Madness. If that be
so, it is but folly To seek a cure for melancholy: Ask where it lies;
the answer saith In Change, in Madness, or in Death. The hour, the
summer season, the solitary place, the voice and skill of the singer,
all contributed to the wonder and delight of the two listeners, who
remained still waiting to hear something more; finding, however, that
the silence continued some little time, they resolved to go in search
of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as they were
about to do so Don Quixote said, "Cover thine eyes, Sancho, and mount;
for one who sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to
deceive us for the sake of the paltry glory to be derived from
deceiving persons who trust in him; though all should turn out the
contrary of what I hope, no malice will be able to dim the glory of
having undertaken this exploit." "Let us be off, senor," said Sancho,
"for I have taken the beards and tears of these ladies deeply to
heart, and I shan't eat a bit to relish it until I have seen them
restored to their former smoothness. Mount, your worship, and
blindfold yourself, for if I am to go on the croup, it is plain the
rider in the saddle must mount first." "That is true," said Don
Quixote, and, taking a handkerchief out of his pocket, he begged the
Distressed One to bandage his eyes very carefully; but after having
them bandaged he uncovered them again, saying, "If my memory does not
deceive me, I have read in Virgil of the Palladium of Troy, a wooden
horse the Greeks offered to the goddess Pallas, which was big with
armed knights, who were afterwards the destruction of Troy; so it
would be as well to see, first of all, what Clavileno has in his
stomach." "There is no occasion," said the Distressed One; "I will be
bail for him, and I know that Malambruno has nothing tricky or
treacherous about him; you may mount without any fear, Senor Don
Quixote; on my head be it if any harm befalls you." Don Quixote
thought that to say anything further with regard to his safety would
be putting his courage in an unfavourable light; and so, without more
words, he mounted Clavileno, and tried the peg, which turned easily;
and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, he looked like
nothing so much as a figure in some Roman triumph painted or
embroidered on a Flemish tapestry. Much against the grain, and very
slowly, Sancho proceeded to mount, and, after settling himself as well
as he could on the croup, found it rather hard, and not at all soft,
and asked the duke if it would be possible to oblige him with a pad of
some kind, or a cushion; even if it were off the couch of his lady the
duchess, or the bed of one of the pages; as the haunches of that horse
were more like marble than wood. On this the Trifaldi observed that
Clavileno would not bear any kind of harness or trappings, and that
his best plan would be to sit sideways like a woman, as in that way he
would not feel the hardness so much. Sancho did so, and, bidding them
farewell, allowed his eyes to be bandaged, but immediately afterwards
uncovered them again, and looking tenderly and tearfully on those in
the garden, bade them help him in his present strait with plenty of
Paternosters and Ave Marias, that God might provide some one to say as
many for them, whenever they found themselves in a similar emergency.
At this Don Quixote exclaimed, "Art thou on the gallows, thief, or at
thy last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? Cowardly,
spiritless creature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalona
occupied, and from which she descended, not into the grave, but to
become Queen of France; unless the histories lie? And I who am here
beside thee, may I not put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres,
who pressed this very spot that I now press? Cover thine eyes, cover
thine eyes, abject animal, and let not thy fear escape thy lips, at
least in my presence." "Blindfold me," said Sancho; "as you won't let
me commend myself or be commended to God, is it any wonder if I am
afraid there is a region of devils about here that will carry us off
to Peralvillo?" They were then blindfolded, and Don Quixote, finding
himself settled to his satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant
he placed his fingers on it, all the duennas and all who stood by
lifted up their voices exclaiming, "God guide thee, valiant knight!
God be with thee, intrepid squire! Now, now ye go cleaving the air
more swiftly than an arrow! Now ye begin to amaze and astonish all who
are gazing at you from the earth! Take care not to wobble about,
valiant Sancho! Mind thou fall not, for thy fall will be worse than
that rash youth's who tried to steer the chariot of his father the
Sun!" As Sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his master and
winding his arms round him, he said, "Senor, how do they make out we
are going up so high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to
be speaking quite close to us?" "Don't mind that, Sancho," said Don
Quixote; "for as affairs of this sort, and flights like this are out
of the common course of things, you can see and hear as much as you
like a thousand leagues off; but don't squeeze me so tight or thou
wilt upset me; and really I know not what thou hast to be uneasy or
frightened at, for I can safely swear I never mounted a smoother-going
steed all the days of my life; one would fancy we never stirred from
one place. Banish fear, my friend, for indeed everything is going as
it ought, and we have the wind astern." "That's true," said Sancho,
"for such a strong wind comes against me on this side, that it seems
as if people were blowing on me with a thousand pair of bellows;"
which was the case; they were puffing at him with a great pair of
bellows; for the whole adventure was so well planned by the duke, the
duchess, and their majordomo, that nothing was omitted to make it
perfectly successful. Don Quixote now, feeling the blast, said,
"Beyond a doubt, Sancho, we must have already reached the second
region of the air, where the hail and snow are generated; the thunder,
the lightning, and the thunderbolts are engendered in the third
region, and if we go on ascending at this rate, we shall shortly
plunge into the region of fire, and I know not how to regulate this
peg, so as not to mount up where we shall be burned." And now they
began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow that could be
easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of a cane.
On feeling the heat Sancho said, "May I die if we are not already in
that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my beard has been
singed, and I have a mind, senor, to uncover and see whereabouts we
are." "Do nothing of the kind," said Don Quixote; "I have only to
command, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order
of knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee
the payment." "Consider what you are saying, senor," said the youth;
"this master of mine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of
knighthood; for he is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar." "That
matters little," replied Don Quixote; "there may be Haldudos knights;
moreover, everyone is the son of his works." "That is true," said
Andres; "but this master of mine--of what works is he the son, when he
refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?" "I do not refuse,
brother Andres," said the farmer, "be good enough to come along with
me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there are in the world
to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed." "For the
perfumery I excuse you," said Don Quixote; "give it to him in reals,
and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; if
not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish
you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard.
And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that
you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don
Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God
be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under
those penalties that have been already declared to you." So saying, he
gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The farmer followed
him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared the wood and
was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said, "Come
here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of
wrongs has commanded me." "My oath on it," said Andres, "your worship
will be well advised to obey the command of that good knight--may he
live a thousand years--for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by
Roque, if you do not pay me, he will come back and do as he said." "My
oath on it, too," said the farmer; "but as I have a strong affection
for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;"
and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a
flogging that he left him for dead. "Now, Master Andres," said the
farmer, "call on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he won't undo
that, though I am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have
a good mind to flay you alive." But at last he untied him, and gave
him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence
pronounced into execution. Andres went off rather down in the mouth,
swearing he would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha
and tell him exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be
repaid him sevenfold; but for all that, he went off weeping, while his
master stood laughing. Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that
wrong, and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place, as he
considered he had made a very happy and noble beginning with his
knighthood, he took the road towards his village in perfect
self-content, saying in a low voice, "Well mayest thou this day call
thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest
of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold subject and
submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned as is
and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world knows,
yesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted
the greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and
cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of
yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child." He
now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he
was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to
consider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted
for a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante
his head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed
out his first intention, which was to make straight for his own
stable. After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a
large party of people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo
traders, on their way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them
coming along under their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and
three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when
the fancy possessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to
help him to imitate as far as he could those passages he had read of
in his books, here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he
resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing and determination he
fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his
buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the middle of the
road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant, for such he
now considered and held them to be; and when they had come near enough
to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, "All the world
stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there is no
maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del
Toboso." The traders halted at the sound of this language and the
sight of the strange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and
language at once guessed the craze of their owner; they wished,
however, to learn quietly what was the object of this confession that
was demanded of them, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke
and was very sharp-witted, said to him, "Sir Knight, we do not know
who this good lady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she
be of such beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any
pressure we will confess the truth that is on your part required of
us." "If I were to show her to you," replied Don Quixote, "what merit
would you have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point
is that without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear,
and defend it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned,
arrogant rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order
of knighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile
usage of your breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the
justice of the cause I maintain." "Sir Knight," replied the trader, "I
entreat your worship in the name of this present company of princes,
that, to save us from charging our consciences with the confession of
a thing we have never seen or heard of, and one moreover so much to
the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens of the Alcarria and
Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us some portrait of
this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat; for by the
thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfied and
easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe we are
already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait should
show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur from
the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all in
her favour that you desire." "She distils nothing of the kind, vile
rabble," said Don Quixote, burning with rage, "nothing of the kind, I
say, only ambergris and civet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or
humpbacked, but straighter than a Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay
for the blasphemy ye have uttered against beauty like that of my
lady." And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one
who had spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not
contrived that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would
have gone hard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over
went his master, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when
he tried to rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance,
buckler, spurs, helmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the
while he was struggling to get up he kept saying, "Fly not, cowards
and caitiffs! stay, for not by my fault, but my horse's, am I
stretched here." One of the muleteers in attendance, who could not
have had much good nature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man
blustering in this style, was unable to refrain from giving him an
answer on his ribs; and coming up to him he seized his lance, and
having broken it in pieces, with one of them he began so to belabour
our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and in spite of his armour, he
milled him like a measure of wheat. His masters called out not to lay
on so hard and to leave him alone, but the muleteers blood was up, and
he did not care to drop the game until he had vented the rest of his
wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of the lance he
finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all through the
storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening heaven,
and earth, and the brigands, for such they seemed to him. At last the
muleteer was tired, and the traders continued their journey, taking
with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been
cudgelled. He when he found himself alone made another effort to rise;
but if he was unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after
having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he
esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him that this was a
regular knight-errant's mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault
of his horse. However, battered in body as he was, to rise was beyond
his power. CHAPTER V. IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT'S MISHAP IS
CONTINUED Finding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought
himself of having recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of
some passage in his books, and his craze brought to his mind that
about Baldwin and the Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded
on the mountain side, a story known by heart by the children, not
forgotten by the young men, and lauded and even believed by the old
folk; and for all that not a whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet.
This seemed to him to fit exactly the case in which he found himself,
so, making a show of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground
and with feeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight
of the wood is said to have uttered: Where art thou, lady mine, that
thou My sorrow dost not rue? Thou canst not know it, lady mine, Or
else thou art untrue. And so he went on with the ballad as far as the
lines: O noble Marquis of Mantua, My Uncle and liege lord! As chance
would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to come by
a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had been with
a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there,
came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with
him that he shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off
his wrist, and rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his
buckler on his arm, put his lance in rest, and making a considerable
circuit of the plain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming: "Whoever
shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided my lady
the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give him the
lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat." The newly arrived
travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote; but the landlord
removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and not to mind him
as he was out of his senses. They then asked the landlord if by any
chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn, one
dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an appearance,
describing that of Dona Clara's lover. The landlord replied that there
were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were
inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which the Judge
had come, said, "He is here no doubt, for this is the coach he is
following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to look
for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the
inn, lest he should escape over the wall of the yard." "So be it,"
said another; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate
and the other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the
landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all
these precautions, though he understood they were looking for the
youth whose description they had given him. It was by this time broad
daylight; and for that reason, as well as in consequence of the noise
Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and up, but particularly
Dona Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to sleep but badly
that night, the one from agitation at having her lover so near her,
the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he saw that not
one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to his
challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath;
and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was
lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in another
enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve
himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he was
pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would have made
them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering that it
would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until he
had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to hold
his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the
proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they
were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought
of anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him. The man laid
hold of him by the arm, saying, "It becomes you well indeed, Senor Don
Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed in which I find
you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you." The youth
rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held him, but
presently recognised him as one of his father's servants, at which he
was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter a
word; while the servant went on to say, "There is nothing for it now,
Senor Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless it is
your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure for the
other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he
is in at your absence." "But how did my father know that I had gone
this road and in this dress?" said Don Luis. "It was a student to whom
you confided your intentions," answered the servant, "that disclosed
them, touched with pity at the distress he saw your father suffer on
missing you; he therefore despatched four of his servants in quest of
you, and here we all are at your service, better pleased than you can
imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to restore you to
those eyes that so yearn for you." "That shall be as I please, or as
heaven orders," returned Don Luis. "What can you please or heaven
order," said the other, "except to agree to go back? Anything else is
impossible." All this conversation between the two was overheard by
the muleteer at whose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report
what had taken place to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who
had by this time dressed themselves; and told them how the man had
addressed the youth as "Don," and what words had passed, and how he
wanted him to return to his father, which the youth was unwilling to
do. With this, and what they already knew of the rare voice that
heaven had bestowed upon him, they all felt very anxious to know more
particularly who he was, and even to help him if it was attempted to
employ force against him; so they hastened to where he was still
talking and arguing with his servant. Dorothea at this instant came
out of her room, followed by Dona Clara all in a tremor; and calling
Cardenio aside, she told him in a few words the story of the musician
and Dona Clara, and he at the same time told her what had happened,
how his father's servants had come in search of him; but in telling
her so, he did not speak low enough but that Dona Clara heard what he
said, at which she was so much agitated that had not Dorothea hastened
to support her she would have fallen to the ground. Cardenio then bade
Dorothea return to her room, as he would endeavour to make the whole
matter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who had come in
quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him, urging
him to return and console his father at once and without a moment's
delay. He replied that he could not do so on any account until he had
concluded some business in which his life, honour, and heart were at
stake. The servants pressed him, saying that most certainly they would
not return without him, and that they would take him away whether he
liked it or not. "You shall not do that," replied Don Luis, "unless
you take me dead; though however you take me, it will be without
life." By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the
dispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the
Judge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered
there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer.
Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man's story, asked
the men who wanted to take him away, what object they had in seeking
to carry off this youth against his will. "Our object," said one of
the four, "is to save the life of his father, who is in danger of
losing it through this gentleman's disappearance." Upon this Don Luis
exclaimed, "There is no need to make my affairs public here; I am
free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none of you shall
compel me." "Reason will compel your worship," said the man, "and if
it has no power over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we
came for, and what it is our duty to do." "Let us hear what the whole
affair is about," said the Judge at this; but the man, who knew him as
a neighbour of theirs, replied, "Do you not know this gentleman, Senor
Judge? He is the son of your neighbour, who has run away from his
father's house in a dress so unbecoming his rank, as your worship may
perceive." The judge on this looked at him more carefully and
recognised him, and embracing him said, "What folly is this, Senor Don
Luis, or what can have been the cause that could have induced you to
come here in this way, and in this dress, which so ill becomes your
condition?" Tears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was
unable to utter a word in reply, still less to decide upon what he
should do. At length he resolved to conduct her to a convent of which
a sister of his was prioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the
speed which the circumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the
convent and left her there, and then himself quitted the city without
letting anyone know of his departure. As soon as daylight came
Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his side, rose cager to learn
what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened to the room where he had
locked her in. He opened the door, entered, but found no Leonela; all
he found was some sheets knotted to the window, a plain proof that she
had let herself down from it and escaped. He returned, uneasy, to tell
Camilla, but not finding her in bed or anywhere in the house he was
lost in amazement. He asked the servants of the house about her, but
none of them could give him any explanation. As he was going in search
of Camilla it happened by chance that he observed her boxes were lying
open, and that the greater part of her jewels were gone; and now he
became fully aware of his disgrace, and that Leonela was not the cause
of his misfortune; and, just as he was, without delaying to dress
himself completely, he repaired, sad at heart and dejected, to his
friend Lothario to make known his sorrow to him; but when he failed to
find him and the servants reported that he had been absent from his
house all night and had taken with him all the money he had, he felt
as though he were losing his senses; and to make all complete on
returning to his own house he found it deserted and empty, not one of
all his servants, male or female, remaining in it. He knew not what to
think, or say, or do, and his reason seemed to be deserting him little
by little. He reviewed his position, and saw himself in a moment left
without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned, he felt, by the heaven
above him, and more than all robbed of his honour, for in Camilla's
disappearance he saw his own ruin. After long reflection he resolved
at last to go to his friend's village, where he had been staying when
he afforded opportunities for the contrivance of this complication of
misfortune. He locked the doors of his house, mounted his horse, and
with a broken spirit set out on his journey; but he had hardly gone
half-way when, harassed by his reflections, he had to dismount and tie
his horse to a tree, at the foot of which he threw himself, giving
vent to piteous heartrending sighs; and there he remained till nearly
nightfall, when he observed a man approaching on horseback from the
city, of whom, after saluting him, he asked what was the news in
Florence. The citizen replied, "The strangest that have been heard for
many a day; for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend
of the wealthy Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last
night Camilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this
has been told by a maid-servant of Camilla's, whom the governor found
last night lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo's
house. I know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all
I know is that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no
one could have expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and
intimate friendship that existed between them, so great, they say,
that they were called 'The Two Friends.'" "Is it known at all," said
Anselmo, "what road Lothario and Camilla took?" "Not in the least,"
said the citizen, "though the governor has been very active in
searching for them." "God speed you, senor," said Anselmo. "God be
with you," said the citizen and went his way. This disastrous
intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his senses but of his
life. He got up as well as he was able and reached the house of his
friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but seeing him come
pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was suffering some heavy
affliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed to retire to rest,
and to be given writing materials. His wish was complied with and he
was left lying down and alone, for he desired this, and even that the
door should be locked. Finding himself alone he so took to heart the
thought of his misfortune that by the signs of death he felt within
him he knew well his life was drawing to a close, and therefore he
resolved to leave behind him a declaration of the cause of his strange
end. He began to write, but before he had put down all he meant to
say, his breath failed him and he yielded up his life, a victim to the
suffering which his ill-advised curiosity had entailed upon him. The
master of the house observing that it was now late and that Anselmo
did not call, determined to go in and ascertain if his indisposition
was increasing, and found him lying on his face, his body partly in
the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he lay with the written
paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having first called to him
without receiving any answer, his host approached him, and taking him
by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he was dead. Greatly
surprised and distressed he summoned the household to witness the sad
fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read the paper, the
handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which contained these
words: "A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the
news of my death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I
forgive her, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to
have required her to perform them; and since I have been the author of
my own dishonour, there is no reason why-" So far Anselmo had written,
and thus it was plain that at this point, before he could finish what
he had to say, his life came to an end. The next day his friend sent
intelligence of his death to his relatives, who had already
ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent where Camilla lay
almost on the point of accompanying her husband on that inevitable
journey, not on account of the tidings of his death, but because of
those she received of her lover's departure. Although she saw herself
a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the convent or take the
veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence reached her that
Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de Lautrec had been
recently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova
in the kingdom of Naples, whither her too late repentant lover had
repaired. On learning this Camilla took the veil, and shortly
afterwards died, worn out by grief and melancholy. This was the end of
all three, an end that came of a thoughtless beginning. "I like this
novel," said the curate; "but I cannot persuade myself of its truth;
and if it has been invented, the author's invention is faulty, for it
is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to try such a
costly experiment as Anselmo's. If it had been represented as
occurring between a gallant and his mistress it might pass; but
between husband and wife there is something of an impossibility about
it. As to the way in which the story is told, however, I have no fault
to find." CHAPTER XXXVI. WHICH TREATS OF MORE CURIOUS INCIDENTS THAT
OCCURRED AT THE INN Just at that instant the landlord, who was
standing at the gate of the inn, exclaimed, "Here comes a fine troop
of guests; if they stop here we may say gaudeamus." "What are they?"
said Cardenio. "Four men," said the landlord, "riding a la jineta,
with lances and bucklers, and all with black veils, and with them
there is a woman in white on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled,
and two attendants on foot." "Are they very near?" said the curate.
"So near," answered the landlord, "that here they come." Hearing this
Dorothea covered her face, and Cardenio retreated into Don Quixote's
room, and they hardly had time to do so before the whole party the
host had described entered the inn, and the four that were on
horseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted,
and came forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle,
and one of them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that
stood at the entrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself.
All this time neither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a
word, only on sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and
let her arms fall like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on
foot then led the horses away to the stable. Observing this the
curate, curious to know who these people in such a dress and
preserving such silence were, went to where the servants were standing
and put the question to one of them, who answered him. "Faith, sir, I
cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to be people of
distinction, particularly he who advanced to take the lady you saw in
his arms; and I say so because all the rest show him respect, and
nothing is done except what he directs and orders." "And the lady, who
is she?" asked the curate. "That I cannot tell you either," said the
servant, "for I have not seen her face all the way: I have indeed
heard her sigh many times and utter such groans that she seems to be
giving up the ghost every time; but it is no wonder if we do not know
more than we have told you, as my comrade and I have only been in
their company two days, for having met us on the road they begged and
persuaded us to accompany them to Andalusia, promising to pay us
well." "And have you heard any of them called by his name?" asked the
curate. "No, indeed," replied the servant; "they all preserve a
marvellous silence on the road, for not a sound is to be heard among
them except the poor lady's sighs and sobs, which make us pity her;
and we feel sure that wherever it is she is going, it is against her
will, and as far as one can judge from her dress she is a nun or, what
is more likely, about to become one; and perhaps it is because taking
the vows is not of her own free will, that she is so unhappy as she
seems to be." "That may well be," said the curate, and leaving them he
returned to where Dorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh,
moved by natural compassion drew near to her and said, "What are you
suffering from, senora? If it be anything that women are accustomed
and know how to relieve, I offer you my services with all my heart."
To this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated
her offers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the gentleman
with the veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest,
approached and said to Dorothea, "Do not give yourself the trouble,
senora, of making any offers to that woman, for it is her way to give
no thanks for anything that is done for her; and do not try to make
her answer unless you want to hear some lie from her lips." "I have
never told a lie," was the immediate reply of her who had been silent
until now; "on the contrary, it is because I am so truthful and so
ignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition;
and this I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth
that has made you false and a liar." Cardenio heard these words
clearly and distinctly, being quite close to the speaker, for there
was only the door of Don Quixote's room between them, and the instant
he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried, "Good God! what is
this I hear? What voice is this that has reached my ears?" Startled at
the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeing the speaker she
stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing which the
gentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step. In her
agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had covered her
face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable and
marvellous beauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her
eyes, everywhere she could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that
made her look as if she had lost her senses, and so marked that it
excited the pity of Dorothea and all who beheld her, though they knew
not what caused it. The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders,
and being so fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to
put a hand to his veil which was falling off, as it did at length
entirely, and Dorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising
her eyes saw that he who likewise held her was her husband, Don
Fernando. The instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive
cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting,
and but for the barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she
would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at once
hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so
Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised
her and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however,
relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to
release herself from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his
voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea's cry as
she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst
forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw was Don
Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio
at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in
silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them. They
gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don
Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio.
The first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed Don
Fernando: "Leave me, Senor Don Fernando, for the sake of what you owe
to yourself; if no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling to
the wall of which I am the ivy, to the support from which neither your
importunities, nor your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts
have been able to detach me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and
hidden from our sight, has brought me face to face with my true
husband; and well you know by dear-bought experience that death alone
will be able to efface him from my memory. May this plain declaration,
then, lead you, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into
rage, your affection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I
yield it up in the presence of my beloved husband I count it well
bestowed; it may be by my death he will be convinced that I kept my
faith to him to the last moment of life." Meanwhile Dorothea had come
to herself, and had heard Luscinda's words, by means of which she
divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando did not yet release
her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as well as she could
she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of bright and
touching tears addressed him thus: "If, my lord, the beams of that sun
that thou holdest eclipsed in thine arms did not dazzle and rob thine
eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen by this time that she who kneels
at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt have it so, the unhappy and
unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly peasant girl whom thou in thy
goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough to call herself
thine; I am she who in the seclusion of innocence led a contented life
until at the voice of thy importunity, and thy true and tender
passion, as it seemed, she opened the gates of her modesty and
surrendered to thee the keys of her liberty; a gift received by thee
but thanklessly, as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place
where thou dost find me, and by thy appearance under the circumstances
in which I see thee. Nevertheless, I would not have thee suppose that
I have come here driven by my shame; it is only grief and sorrow at
seeing myself forgotten by thee that have led me. It was thy will to
make me thine, and thou didst so follow thy will, that now, even
though thou repentest, thou canst not help being mine. Bethink thee,
my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bear thee may compensate for
the beauty and noble birth for which thou wouldst desert me. Thou
canst not be the fair Luscinda's because thou art mine, nor can she be
thine because she is Cardenio's; and it will be easier, remember, to
bend thy will to love one who adores thee, than to lead one to love
thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst address thyself to my simplicity,
thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert not ignorant of my
station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to thy will; there
is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and if it be so,
as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a gentleman, why
dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy at last as
thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I am, thy
true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave, for so
long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do not by
deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the
streets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal
services they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not
deserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy
blood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no
nobility in the world that has not travelled the same road, and that
in illustrious lineages it is not the woman's blood that is of
account; and, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if
thou art wanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me,
then even I have higher claims to nobility than thine. To make an end,
senor, these are my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt
not, I am thy wife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to
be false, if thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou
scornest me; witness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness
Heaven, which thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou
hadst made me; and if all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail
to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and
vindicate the truth of what I say and mar thy highest pleasure and
enjoyment." All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such
earnest feeling and such tears that all present, even those who came
with Don Fernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando
listened to her without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave
way to such sobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass
that was not softened by the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood
regarding her with no less compassion for her sufferings than
admiration for her intelligence and beauty, and would have gone to her
to say some words of comfort to her, but was prevented by Don
Fernando's grasp which held her fast. He, overwhelmed with confusion
and astonishment, after regarding Dorothea for some moments with a
fixed gaze, opened his arms, and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed: "Thou
hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is
impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many
truths." Luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the
ground when Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near,
having retreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting
fear aside and regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support
her, and said as he clasped her in his arms, "If Heaven in its
compassion is willing to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart,
true, constant, and fair, nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in
these arms that now receive thee, and received thee before when
fortune permitted me to call thee mine." At these words Luscinda
looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to recognise him by his
voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that it was he, and
hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all considerations of
decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and pressing her face
close to his, said, "Yes, my dear lord, you are the true master of
this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose again, and fresh
dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours." A strange sight was
this for Don Fernando and those that stood around, filled with
surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied that Don
Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take
vengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword;
and the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she
clasped him round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to
prevent his moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, "What
is it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou
hast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife
is in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it will be right for
thee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what Heaven has
done, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to
be thy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth
and constancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love
the face and bosom of her lawful husband. For God's sake I entreat of
thee, for thine own I implore thee, let not this open manifestation
rouse thy anger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to
live in peace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as
Heaven permits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of
thy lofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with thee reason
has more influence than passion." All the time Dorothea was speaking,
Cardenio, though he held Luscinda in his arms, never took his eyes off
Don Fernando, determined, if he saw him make any hostile movement, to
try and defend himself and resist as best he could all who might
assail him, though it should cost him his life. But now Don Fernando's
friends, as well as the curate and the barber, who had been present
all the while, not forgetting the worthy Sancho Panza, ran forward and
gathered round Don Fernando, entreating him to have regard for the
tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her reasonable hopes to be
disappointed, since, as they firmly believed, what she said was but
the truth; and bidding him observe that it was not, as it might seem,
by accident, but by a special disposition of Providence that they had
all met in a place where no one could have expected a meeting. And the
curate bade him remember that only death could part Luscinda from
Cardenio; that even if some sword were to separate them they would
think their death most happy; and that in a case that admitted of no
remedy his wisest course was, by conquering and putting a constraint
upon himself, to show a generous mind, and of his own accord suffer
these two to enjoy the happiness Heaven had granted them. He bade him,
too, turn his eyes upon the beauty of Dorothea and he would see that
few if any could equal much less excel her; while to that beauty
should be added her modesty and the surpassing love she bore him. But
besides all this, he reminded him that if he prided himself on being a
gentleman and a Christian, he could not do otherwise than keep his
plighted word; and that in doing so he would obey God and meet the
approval of all sensible people, who know and recognised it to be the
privilege of beauty, even in one of humble birth, provided virtue
accompany it, to be able to raise itself to the level of any rank,
without any slur upon him who places it upon an equality with himself;
and furthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts itself,
so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, he is not to be blamed
who gives way to it. To be brief, they added to these such other
forcible arguments that Don Fernando's manly heart, being after all
nourished by noble blood, was touched, and yielded to the truth which,
even had he wished it, he could not gainsay; and he showed his
submission, and acceptance of the good advice that had been offered to
him, by stooping down and embracing Dorothea, saying to her, "Rise,
dear lady, it is not right that what I hold in my heart should be
kneeling at my feet; and if until now I have shown no sign of what I
own, it may have been by Heaven's decree in order that, seeing the
constancy with which you love me, I may learn to value you as you
deserve. What I entreat of you is that you reproach me not with my
transgression and grievous wrong-doing; for the same cause and force
that drove me to make you mine impelled me to struggle against being
yours; and to prove this, turn and look at the eyes of the now happy
Luscinda, and you will see in them an excuse for all my errors: and as
she has found and gained the object of her desires, and I have found
in you what satisfies all my wishes, may she live in peace and
contentment as many happy years with her Cardenio, as on my knees I
pray Heaven to allow me to live with my Dorothea;" and with these
words he once more embraced her and pressed his face to hers with so
much tenderness that he had to take great heed to keep his tears from
completing the proof of his love and repentance in the sight of all.
Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and almost all the others, for they
shed so many tears, some in their own happiness, some at that of the
others, that one would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon
them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he
only wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen
Micomicona, of whom he expected such great favours. Their wonder as
well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda
went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks
for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he
knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with
every mark of affection and courtesy. He then asked Dorothea how she
had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home, and she
in a few fitting words told all that she had previously related to
Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companions were so delighted
that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea
describe her misadventures. When she had finished Don Fernando
recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had found in
Luscinda's bosom the paper in which she declared that she was
Cardenio's wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill her,
and would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and
that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to
avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer. The
next day he learned that Luscinda had disappeared from her father's
house, and that no one could tell whither she had gone. Finally, at
the end of some months he ascertained that she was in a convent and
meant to remain there all the rest of her life, if she were not to
share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this, taking
these three gentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the place where
she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing that if it were known he
was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent; and
watching a time when the porter's lodge was open he left two to guard
the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in quest of
Luscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of
the nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, they
reached a place with her where they provided themselves with what they
required for taking her away; all which they were able to do in
complete safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable
distance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found herself in
his power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself
did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in
silence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reaching
heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.
CHAPTER XXXVII. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS
MICOMICONA, WITH OTHER DROLL ADVENTURES To all this Sancho listened
with no little sorrow at heart to see how his hopes of dignity were
fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the fair Princess
Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into Don Fernando,
while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious of all
that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that
her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar
state of mind, and Luscinda's thoughts ran in the same direction. Don
Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for
having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been
brought so near the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and
in short everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction
at the happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business. The
curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair,
and congratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in
the highest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of the
promise Cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the
losses and damage she had sustained through Don Quixote's means.
Sancho, as has been already said, was the only one who was distressed,
unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long face he went in to his
master, who had just awoke, and said to him: "Sir Rueful Countenance,
your worship may as well sleep on as much as you like, without
troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her kingdom to
the princess; for that is all over and settled now." "I should think
it was," replied Don Quixote, "for I have had the most prodigious and
stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember having had all
the days of my life; and with one back-stroke-swish!--I brought his
head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth from him
that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water." "Like red wine,
your worship had better say," replied Sancho; "for I would have you
know, if you don't know it, that the dead giant is a hacked wine-skin,
and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it had in its
belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and the devil
take it all." "What art thou talking about, fool?" said Don Quixote;
"art thou in thy senses?" "Let your worship get up," said Sancho, "and
you will see the nice business you have made of it, and what we have
to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady called
Dorothea, and other things that will astonish you, if you understand
them." "I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind," returned
Don Quixote; "for if thou dost remember the last time we were here I
told thee that everything that happened here was a matter of
enchantment, and it would be no wonder if it were the same now." "I
could believe all that," replied Sancho, "if my blanketing was the
same sort of thing also; only it wasn't, but real and genuine; for I
saw the landlord, Who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket
and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as
much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing
people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is
no enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad
luck." "Well, well, God will give a remedy," said Don Quixote; "hand
me my clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these
transformations and things thou speakest of." Sancho fetched him his
clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate gave Don Fernando and
the others present an account of Don Quixote's madness and of the
stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from that Pena Pobre
where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady's scorn. He
described to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho had
mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking
it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could
be capable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea's good
fortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose, it would be
necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home.
Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and
suggested that Luscinda would act and support Dorothea's part
sufficiently well. "No," said Don Fernando, "that must not be, for I
want Dorothea to follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy
gentleman's village is not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do
anything for his relief." "It is not more than two days' journey from
this," said the curate. "Even if it were more," said Don Fernando, "I
would gladly travel so far for the sake of doing so good a work. "At
this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino's
helmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and
leaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled
Don Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean
yellow face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the
solemnity of his deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he
would say, and he, fixing his eyes on the air Dorothea, addressed her
with great gravity and composure: "I am informed, fair lady, by my
squire here that your greatness has been annihilated and your being
abolished, since, from a queen and lady of high degree as you used to
be, you have been turned into a private maiden. If this has been done
by the command of the magician king your father, through fear that I
should not afford you the aid you need and are entitled to, I may tell
you he did not know and does not know half the mass, and was little
versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he had read and gone through
them as attentively and deliberately as I have, he would have found at
every turn that knights of less renown than mine have accomplished
things more difficult: it is no great matter to kill a whelp of a
giant, however arrogant he may be; for it is not many hours since I
myself was engaged with one, and-I will not speak of it, that they may
not say I am lying; time, however, that reveals all, will tell the
tale when we least expect it." "You were engaged with a couple of
wine-skins, and not a giant," said the landlord at this; but Don
Fernando told him to hold his tongue and on no account interrupt Don
Quixote, who continued, "I say in conclusion, high and disinherited
lady, that if your father has brought about this metamorphosis in your
person for the reason I have mentioned, you ought not to attach any
importance to it; for there is no peril on earth through which my
sword will not force a way, and with it, before many days are over, I
will bring your enemy's head to the ground and place on yours the
crown of your kingdom." Don Quixote said no more, and waited for the
reply of the princess, who aware of Don Fernando's determination to
carry on the deception until Don Quixote had been conveyed to his
home, with great ease of manner and gravity made answer, "Whoever told
you, valiant Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that I had undergone
any change or transformation did not tell you the truth, for I am the
same as I was yesterday. It is true that certain strokes of good
fortune, that have given me more than I could have hoped for, have
made some alteration in me; but I have not therefore ceased to be what
I was before, or to entertain the same desire I have had all through
of availing myself of the might of your valiant and invincible arm.
And so, senor, let your goodness reinstate the father that begot me in
your good opinion, and be assured that he was a wise and prudent man,
since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of remedying
my misfortune; for I believe, senor, that had it not been for you I
should never have lit upon the good fortune I now possess; and in this
I am saying what is perfectly true; as most of these gentlemen who are
present can fully testify. All that remains is to set out on our
journey to-morrow, for to-day we could not make much way; and for the
rest of the happy result I am looking forward to, I trust to God and
the valour of your heart." So said the sprightly Dorothea, and on
hearing her Don Quixote turned to Sancho, and said to him, with an
angry air, "I declare now, little Sancho, thou art the greatest little
villain in Spain. Say, thief and vagabond, hast thou not just now told
me that this princess had been turned into a maiden called Dorothea,
and that the head which I am persuaded I cut off from a giant was the
bitch that bore thee, and other nonsense that put me in the greatest
perplexity I have ever been in all my life? I vow" (and here he looked
to heaven and ground his teeth) "I have a mind to play the mischief
with thee, in a way that will teach sense for the future to all lying
squires of knights-errant in the world." "Let your worship be calm,
senor," returned Sancho, "for it may well be that I have been mistaken
as to the change of the lady princess Micomicona; but as to the
giant's head, or at least as to the piercing of the wine-skins, and
the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as sure as there is a
God; because the wounded skins are there at the head of your worship's
bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not you will see
when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship the landlord
calls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartily glad that her
ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as much as
anyone." "I tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool," said Don
Quixote; "forgive me, and that will do." "That will do," said Don
Fernando; "let us say no more about it; and as her ladyship the
princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it is too late to-day,
so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasant conversation, and
to-morrow we will all accompany Senor Don Quixote; for we wish to
witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is about to
perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has
undertaken." "It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you," said Don
Quixote; "and I am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon
me, and the good opinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to
justify or it shall cost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly
cost me more." Many were the compliments and expressions of politeness
that passed between Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were
brought to an end by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn,
and who seemed from his attire to be a Christian lately come from the
country of the Moors, for he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of
blue cloth with half-sleeves and without a collar; his breeches were
also of blue cloth, and his cap of the same colour, and he wore yellow
buskins and had a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his
breast. Behind him, mounted upon an ass, there came a woman dressed in
Moorish fashion, with her face veiled and a scarf on her head, and
wearing a little brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered her from her
shoulders to her feet. The man was of a robust and well-proportioned
frame, in age a little over forty, rather swarthy in complexion, with
long moustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his appearance was
such that if he had been well dressed he would have been taken for a
person of quality and good birth. On entering he asked for a room, and
when they told him there was none in the inn he seemed distressed, and
approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor he her down from
saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, her daughter and
Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely new
costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,
courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who
had brought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, "Do
not be put out, senora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here,
for it is the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you
will be pleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda)
perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your
journey." To this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to
rise from her seat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head
and bending her body as a sign that she returned thanks. From her
silence they concluded that she must be a Moor and unable to speak a
Christian tongue. At this moment the captive came up, having been
until now otherwise engaged, and seeing that they all stood round his
companion and that she made no reply to what they addressed to her, he
said, "Ladies, this damsel hardly understands my language and can
speak none but that of her own country, for which reason she does not
and cannot answer what has been asked of her." "Nothing has been asked
of her," returned Luscinda; "she has only been offered our company for
this evening and a share of the quarters we occupy, where she shall be
made as comfortable as the circumstances allow, with the good-will we
are bound to show all strangers that stand in need of it, especially
if it be a woman to whom the service is rendered." "On her part and my
own, senora," replied the captive, "I kiss your hands, and I esteem
highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered, which, on such an
occasion and coming from persons of your appearance, is, it is plain
to see, a very great one." "Tell me, senor," said Dorothea, "is this
lady a Christian or a Moor? for her dress and her silence lead us to
imagine that she is what we could wish she was not." "In dress and
outwardly," said he, "she is a Moor, but at heart she is a thoroughly
good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become one." "Then
she has not been baptised?" returned Luscinda. "There has been no
opportunity for that," replied the captive, "since she left Algiers,
her native country and home; and up to the present she has not found
herself in any such imminent danger of death as to make it necessary
to baptise her before she has been instructed in all the ceremonies
our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere long she shall be
baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is higher than her
dress or mine indicates." By these words he excited a desire in all
who heard him, to know who the Moorish lady and the captive were, but
no one liked to ask just then, seeing that it was a fitter moment for
helping them to rest themselves than for questioning them about their
lives. Dorothea took the Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a
seat beside herself, requested her to remove her veil. She looked at
the captive as if to ask him what they meant and what she was to do.
He said to her in Arabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and
thereupon she removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that
to Dorothea she seemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda
more beautiful than Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any
beauty could compare with theirs it was the Moorish lady's, and there
were even those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference.
And as it is the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and
secure good-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and
attention to the lovely Moor. Don Fernando asked the captive what her
name was, and he replied that it was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she
heard him, she guessed what the Christian had asked, and said hastily,
with some displeasure and energy, "No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!"
giving them to understand that she was called "Maria" and not
"Zoraida." These words, and the touching earnestness with which she
uttered them, drew more than one tear from some of the listeners,
particularly the women, who are by nature tender-hearted and
compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately, saying, "Yes,
yes, Maria, Maria," to which the Moor replied, "Yes, yes, Maria;
Zoraida macange," which means "not Zoraida." Night was now
approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied Don Fernando
the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the best
supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having arrived they
all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round
or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at
the head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned to Don
Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his side,
as he was her protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places next
her, opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the
captive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the
curate and the barber. And so they supped in high enjoyment, which was
increased when they observed Don Quixote leave off eating, and, moved
by an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at such length
when he supped with the goatherds, begin to address them: "Verily,
gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the things
they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry. Say,
what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this
castle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or
imagine us to be what we are? Who would say that this lady who is
beside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am
that Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the
mouth of Fame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling
surpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more
deserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more
exposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have the
preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that
they know not what they say. For the reason which such persons
commonly assign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the
labours of the mind are greater than those of the body, and that arms
give employment to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter's
trade, for which nothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as
if, in what we who profess them call arms, there were not included
acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence is
requisite; or as if the soul of the warrior, when he has an army, or
the defence of a city under his care, did not exert itself as much by
mind as by body. Nay; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to
learn or divine the intentions of the enemy, his plans, stratagems, or
obstacles, or to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the
work of the mind, and in them the body has no share whatever. Since,
therefore, arms have need of the mind, as much as letters, let us see
now which of the two minds, that of the man of letters or that of the
warrior, has most to do; and this will be seen by the end and goal
that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the more estimable
which has for its aim the nobler object. The end and goal of
letters--I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of which is
to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite no
other can be compared--I speak of human letters, the end of which is
to establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is
his, and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end
undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not such
as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their end
and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this life.
The first good news the world and mankind received was that which the
angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in the
air, 'Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of
good-will;' and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and
earth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any
house, was to say, 'Peace be on this house;' and many other times he
said to them, 'My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace
be with you;' a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a
hand: a jewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth
or in heaven. This peace is the true end of war; and war is only
another name for arms. This, then, being admitted, that the end of war
is peace, and that so far it has the advantage of the end of letters,
let us turn to the bodily labours of the man of letters, and those of
him who follows the profession of arms, and see which are the
greater." Don Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in
such correct language, that for the time being he made it impossible
for any of his hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as
they were mostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth,
they listened to him with great pleasure as he continued: "Here, then,
I say is what the student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not
that all are poor, but to put the case as strongly as possible: and
when I have said that he endures poverty, I think nothing more need be
said about his hard fortune, for he who is poor has no share of the
good things of life. This poverty he suffers from in various ways,
hunger, or cold, or nakedness, or all together; but for all that it is
not so extreme but that he gets something to eat, though it may be at
somewhat unseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the
greatest misery of the student is what they themselves call 'going out
for soup,' and there is always some neighbour's brazier or hearth for
them, which, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them,
and lastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a roof. I will not
go into other particulars, as for example want of shirts, and no
superabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorging
themselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated
them to a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described,
rough and hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to
fall again, they reach the rank they desire, and that once attained,
we have seen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and
Charybdises, as if borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we
have seen them, I say, ruling and governing the world from a chair,
their hunger turned into satiety, their cold into comfort, their
nakedness into fine raiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in
holland and damask, the justly earned reward of their virtue; but,
contrasted and compared with what the warrior undergoes, all they have
undergone falls far short of it, as I am now about to show." CHAPTER
XXXVIII. WHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED
ON ARMS AND LETTERS Continuing his discourse Don Quixote said: "As we
began in the student's case with poverty and its accompaniments, let
us see now if the soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty
itself there is no one poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable
pay, which comes late or never, or else on what he can plunder,
seriously imperilling his life and conscience; and sometimes his
nakedness will be so great that a slashed doublet serves him for
uniform and shirt, and in the depth of winter he has to defend himself
against the inclemency of the weather in the open field with nothing
better than the breath of his mouth, which I need not say, coming from
an empty place, must come out cold, contrary to the laws of nature. To
be sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make up for all
these discomforts on the bed that awaits him, which, unless by some
fault of his, never sins by being over narrow, for he can easily
measure out on the ground as he likes, and roll himself about in it to
his heart's content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from
him. Then, after all this, suppose the day and hour for taking his
degree in his calling to have come; suppose the day of battle to have
arrived, when they invest him with the doctor's cap made of lint, to
mend some bullet-hole, perhaps, that has gone through his temples, or
left him with a crippled arm or leg. Or if this does not happen, and
merciful Heaven watches over him and keeps him safe and sound, it may
be he will be in the same poverty he was in before, and he must go
through more engagements and more battles, and come victorious out of
all before he betters himself; but miracles of that sort are seldom
seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have ever reflected upon it, by how
much do those who have gained by war fall short of the number of those
who have perished in it? No doubt you will reply that there can be no
comparison, that the dead cannot be numbered, while the living who
have been rewarded may be summed up with three figures. All which is
the reverse in the case of men of letters; for by skirts, to say
nothing of sleeves, they all find means of support; so that though the
soldier has more to endure, his reward is much less. But against all
this it may be urged that it is easier to reward two thousand
soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by giving them places,
which must perforce be conferred upon men of their calling, while the
latter can only be recompensed out of the very property of the master
they serve; but this impossibility only strengthens my argument.
"Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which
it is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority
of arms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the
arguments put forward on each side; for besides those I have
mentioned, letters say that without them arms cannot maintain
themselves, for war, too, has its laws and is governed by them, and
laws belong to the domain of letters and men of letters. To this arms
make answer that without them laws cannot be maintained, for by arms
states are defended, kingdoms preserved, cities protected, roads made
safe, seas cleared of pirates; and, in short, if it were not for them,
states, kingdoms, monarchies, cities, ways by sea and land would be
exposed to the violence and confusion which war brings with it, so
long as it lasts and is free to make use of its privileges and powers.
And then it is plain that whatever costs most is valued and deserves
to be valued most. To attain to eminence in letters costs a man time,
watching, hunger, nakedness, headaches, indigestions, and other things
of the sort, some of which I have already referred to. But for a man
to come in the ordinary course of things to be a good soldier costs
him all the student suffers, and in an incomparably higher degree, for
at every step he runs the risk of losing his life. For what dread of
want or poverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with
what the soldier feels, who finds himself beleaguered in some
stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin or cavalier, knows that the
enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where he is stationed, and
cannot under any circumstances retire or fly from the imminent danger
that threatens him? All he can do is to inform his captain of what is
going on so that he may try to remedy it by a counter-mine, and then
stand his ground in fear and expectation of the moment when he will
fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into the deep against
his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us see whether it is
equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys stem to stem, in
the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one with the other,
when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the plank
of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him threatening him as
many ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him,
not a lance length from his body, and sees too that with the first
heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities of Neptune's
bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that nerves him,
he makes himself a target for all that musketry, and struggles to
cross that narrow path to the enemy's ship. And what is still more
marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he will never
rise from till the end of the world, than another takes his place; and
if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an enemy, another
and another will succeed him without a moment's pause between their
deaths: courage and daring the greatest that all the chances of war
can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread fury of those
devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am persuaded is in
hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention, by which he
made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life of a gallant
gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in the height of
the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts, there
should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one who fled in
terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine, which in
an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life of one
who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect on
this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having
adopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we
live in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me
some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the
opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known
earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But Heaven's
will be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more
honoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of
yore exposed themselves to." All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote
delivered while the others supped, forgetting to raise a morsel to his
lips, though Sancho more than once told him to eat his supper, as he
would have time enough afterwards to say all he wanted. It excited
fresh pity in those who had heard him to see a man of apparently sound
sense, and with rational views on every subject he discussed, so
hopelessly wanting in all, when his wretched unlucky chivalry was in
question. The curate told him he was quite right in all he had said in
favour of arms, and that he himself, though a man of letters and a
graduate, was of the same opinion. They finished their supper, the
cloth was removed, and while the hostess, her daughter, and Maritornes
were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha's garret ready, in which it was
arranged that the women were to be quartered by themselves for the
night, Don Fernando begged the captive to tell them the story of his
life, for it could not fail to be strange and interesting, to judge by
the hints he had let fall on his arrival in company with Zoraida. To
this the captive replied that he would very willingly yield to his
request, only he feared his tale would not give them as much pleasure
as he wished; nevertheless, not to be wanting in compliance, he would
tell it. The curate and the others thanked him and added their
entreaties, and he finding himself so pressed said there was no
occasion ask, where a command had such weight, and added, "If your
worships will give me your attention you will hear a true story which,
perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studied art
cannot come up to." These words made them settle themselves in their
places and preserve a deep silence, and he seeing them waiting on his
words in mute expectation, began thus in a pleasant quiet voice.
CHAPTER XXXIX. WHEREIN THE CAPTIVE RELATES HIS LIFE AND ADVENTURES My
family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he
mentioned a circumstance connected with his father and his brothers
which, had it not been told me by so truthful a man as he was, I
should have set down as one of those fables the old women tell over
the fire in winter; for he said his father had divided his property
among his three sons and had addressed words of advice to them sounder
than any of Cato's. But I can say this much, that the choice he made
of going to the wars was attended with such success, that by his
gallant conduct and courage, and without any help save his own merit,
he rose in a few years to be captain of infantry, and to see himself
on the high-road and in position to be given the command of a corps
before long; but Fortune was against him, for where he might have
expected her favour he lost it, and with it his liberty, on that
glorious day when so many recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto.
I lost mine at the Goletta, and after a variety of adventures we found
ourselves comrades at Constantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where
he met with one of the most extraordinary adventures that ever befell
anyone in the world." Here the curate went on to relate briefly his
brother's adventure with Zoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an
attentive hearing that he never before had been so much of a hearer.
The curate, however, only went so far as to describe how the Frenchmen
plundered those who were in the boat, and the poverty and distress in
which his comrade and the fair Moor were left, of whom he said he had
not been able to learn what became of them, or whether they had
reached Spain, or been carried to France by the Frenchmen. The
captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the
curate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon
as he perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep
sigh and said with his eyes full of tears, "Oh, senor, if you only
knew what news you have given me and how it comes home to me, making
me show how I feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in
spite of all my worldly wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain
that you speak of is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and
loftier mind than my other brother or myself, chose the honourable and
worthy calling of arms, which was one of the three careers our father
proposed to us, as your comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he
was telling you. I followed that of letters, in which God and my own
exertions have raised me to the position in which you see me. My
second brother is in Peru, so wealthy that with what he has sent to my
father and to me he has fully repaid the portion he took with him, and
has even furnished my father's hands with the means of gratifying his
natural generosity, while I too have been enabled to pursue my studies
in a more becoming and creditable fashion, and so to attain my present
standing. My father is still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear
of his eldest son, and he prays God unceasingly that death may not
close his eyes until he has looked upon those of his son; but with
regard to him what surprises me is, that having so much common sense
as he had, he should have neglected to give any intelligence about
himself, either in his troubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity,
for if his father or any of us had known of his condition he need not
have waited for that miracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but
what now disquiets me is the uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may
have restored him to liberty, or murdered him to hide the robbery. All
this will make me continue my journey, not with the satisfaction in
which I began it, but in the deepest melancholy and sadness. Oh dear
brother! that I only knew where thou art now, and I would hasten to
seek thee out and deliver thee from thy sufferings, though it were to
cost me suffering myself! Oh that I could bring news to our old father
that thou art alive, even wert thou the deepest dungeon of Barbary;
for his wealth and my brother's and mine would rescue thee thence! Oh
beautiful and generous Zoraida, that I could repay thy good goodness
to a brother! That I could be present at the new birth of thy soul,
and at thy bridal that would give us all such happiness!" All this and
more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news he had
received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it, showing
their sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how well he
had succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain's wishes,
had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from the
table and going into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the
hand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge's daughter following her. The
captain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter,
taking him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where
the Judge and the other gentlemen were and said, "Let your tears cease
to flow, Senor Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully
as you could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and
your good sister-in-law. He whom you see here is the Captain Viedma,
and this is the fair Moor who has been so good to him. The Frenchmen I
told you of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you
may show the generosity of your kind heart." The captain ran to
embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his breast so as to have
a good look at him, holding him a little way off but as soon as he had
fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms so closely, shedding
such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those present could not but
join in them. The words the brothers exchanged, the emotion they
showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less put down in
writing. They told each other in a few words the events of their
lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength;
then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at her
disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fair
Christian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye. And
there was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedings
attentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole to
chimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed that the captain and
Zoraida should return with his brother to Seville, and send news to
his father of his having been delivered and found, so as to enable him
to come and be present at the marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it
was impossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as he was
informed that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from
Seville for New Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great
inconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at
the captive's good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night
were past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it.
Don Quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be
attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the
great treasure of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood
him returned him thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an
account of his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little
amused. Sancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for
retiring to rest; and he of all was the one that made himself most
comfortable, as he stretched himself on the trappings of his ass,
which, as will be told farther on, cost him so dear. The ladies, then,
having retired to their chamber, and the others having disposed
themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don Quixote
sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had
promised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach of
dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that
it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea, who
had been awake, and by whose side Dona Clara de Viedma, for so the
Judge's daughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it
was that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any
instrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in
the courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all
attention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, "Listen,
whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer's voice that
enchants as it chants." "We are listening to it already, senor," said
Dorothea; on which Cardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her
attention to it, made out the words of the song to be these: CHAPTER
XLIII. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE PLEASANT STORY OF THE MULETEER, TOGETHER
WITH OTHER STRANGE THINGS THAT CAME TO PASS IN THE INN Ah me, Love's
mariner am I On Love's deep ocean sailing; I know not where the haven
lies, I dare not hope to gain it. One solitary distant star Is all I
have to guide me, A brighter orb than those of old That Palinurus
lighted. And vaguely drifting am I borne, I know not where it leads
me; I fix my gaze on it alone, Of all beside it heedless. But
over-cautious prudery, And coyness cold and cruel, When most I need
it, these, like clouds, Its longed-for light refuse me. Bright star,
goal of my yearning eyes As thou above me beamest, When thou shalt
hide thee from my sight I'll know that death is near me. The singer
had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair to let
Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side to
side, she woke her, saying: "Forgive me, child, for waking thee, but I
do so that thou mayest have the pleasure of hearing the best voice
thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in all thy life." Clara awoke quite
drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what Dorothea said, asked
her what it was; she repeated what she had said, and Clara became
attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines, as the singer
continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she were
suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her arms
round Dorothea she said: "Ah, dear lady of my soul and life! why did
you wake me? The greatest kindness fortune could do me now would be to
close my eyes and ears so as neither to see or hear that unhappy
musician." "What art thou talking about, child?" said Dorothea. "Why,
they say this singer is a muleteer!" "Nay, he is the lord of many
places," replied Clara, "and that one in my heart which he holds so
firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he be willing to
surrender it." Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl,
for it seemed to be far beyond such experience of life as her tender
years gave any promise of, so she said to her: "You speak in such a
way that I cannot understand you, Senora Clara; explain yourself more
clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying about hearts and
places and this musician whose voice has so moved you? But do not tell
me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I get from
listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports, for
I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air." "Let
him, in Heaven's name," returned Clara; and not to hear him she
stopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again
surprised; but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran
in this fashion: Sweet Hope, my stay, That onward to the goal of thy
intent Dost make thy way, Heedless of hindrance or impediment, Have
thou no fear If at each step thou findest death is near. No victory,
No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know; Unblest is he That a bold
front to Fortune dares not show, But soul and sense In bondage
yieldeth up to indolence. If Love his wares Do dearly sell, his right
must be contest; What gold compares With that whereon his stamp he
hath imprest? And all men know What costeth little that we rate but
low. Love resolute Knows not the word "impossibility;" And though my
suit Beset by endless obstacles I see, Yet no despair Shall hold me
bound to earth while heaven is there. Here the voice ceased and
Clara's sobs began afresh, all which excited Dorothea's curiosity to
know what could be the cause of singing so sweet and weeping so
bitter, so she again asked her what it was she was going to say
before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear her,
winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to her
ear that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone else,
and said: "This singer, dear senora, is the son of a gentleman of
Aragon, lord of two villages, who lives opposite my father's house at
Madrid; and though my father had curtains to the windows of his house
in winter, and lattice-work in summer, in some way--I know not
how--this gentleman, who was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in
church or elsewhere, I cannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with
me, and gave me to know it from the windows of his house, with so many
signs and tears that I was forced to believe him, and even to love
him, without knowing what it was he wanted of me. One of the signs he
used to make me was to link one hand in the other, to show me he
wished to marry me; and though I should have been glad if that could
be, being alone and motherless I knew not whom to open my mind to, and
so I left it as it was, showing him no favour, except when my father,
and his too, were from home, to raise the curtain or the lattice a
little and let him see me plainly, at which he would show such delight
that he seemed as if he were going mad. Meanwhile the time for my
father's departure arrived, which he became aware of, but not from me,
for I had never been able to tell him of it. He fell sick, of grief I
believe, and so the day we were going away I could not see him to take
farewell of him, were it only with the eyes. But after we had been two
days on the road, on entering the posada of a village a day's journey
from this, I saw him at the inn door in the dress of a muleteer, and
so well disguised, that if I did not carry his image graven on my
heart it would have been impossible for me to recognise him. But I
knew him, and I was surprised, and glad; he watched me, unsuspected by
my father, from whom he always hides himself when he crosses my path
on the road, or in the posadas where we halt; and, as I know what he
is, and reflect that for love of me he makes this journey on foot in
all this hardship, I am ready to die of sorrow; and where he sets foot
there I set my eyes. I know not with what object he has come; or how
he could have got away from his father, who loves him beyond measure,
having no other heir, and because he deserves it, as you will perceive
when you see him. And moreover, I can tell you, all that he sings is
out of his own head; for I have heard them say he is a great scholar
and poet; and what is more, every time I see him or hear him sing I
tremble all over, and am terrified lest my father should recognise him
and come to know of our loves. I have never spoken a word to him in my
life; and for all that I love him so that I could not live without
him. This, dear senora, is all I have to tell you about the musician
whose voice has delighted you so much; and from it alone you might
easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord of hearts and towns, as
I told you already." "Say no more, Dona Clara," said Dorothea at this,
at the same time kissing her a thousand times over, "say no more, I
tell you, but wait till day comes; when I trust in God to arrange this
affair of yours so that it may have the happy ending such an innocent
beginning deserves." "Ah, senora," said Dona Clara, "what end can be
hoped for when his father is of such lofty position, and so wealthy,
that he would think I was not fit to be even a servant to his son,
much less wife? And as to marrying without the knowledge of my father,
I would not do it for all the world. I would not ask anything more
than that this youth should go back and leave me; perhaps with not
seeing him, and the long distance we shall have to travel, the pain I
suffer now may become easier; though I daresay the remedy I propose
will do me very little good. I don't know how the devil this has come
about, or how this love I have for him got in; I such a young girl,
and he such a mere boy; for I verily believe we are both of an age,
and I am not sixteen yet; for I will be sixteen Michaelmas Day, next,
my father says." Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a
child Dona Clara spoke. "Let us go to sleep now, senora," said she,
"for the little of the night that I fancy is left to us: God will soon
send us daylight, and we will set all to rights, or it will go hard
with me." With this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all
through the inn. The only persons not asleep were the landlady's
daughter and her servant Maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of
Don Quixote's humour, and that he was outside the inn mounting guard
in armour and on horseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some
trick upon him, or at any rate to amuse themselves for a while by
listening to his nonsense. As it so happened there was not a window in
the whole inn that looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a
straw-loft through which they used to throw out the straw. At this
hole the two demi-damsels posted themselves, and observed Don Quixote
on his horse, leaning on his pike and from time to time sending forth
such deep and doleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck up his soul by
the roots with each of them; and they could hear him, too, saying in a
soft, tender, loving tone, "Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, perfection
of all beauty, summit and crown of discretion, treasure house of
grace, depositary of virtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good,
honourable, and delectable in this world! What is thy grace doing now?
Art thou, perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own
free will hath exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve
thee? Give me tidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps
at this moment, envious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she
paces to and fro some gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over
some balcony, meditating how, whilst preserving her purity and
greatness, she may mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine
endures for her sake, what glory should recompense my sufferings, what
repose my toil, and lastly what death my life, and what reward my
services? And thou, oh sun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy
steeds in haste to rise betimes and come forth to see my lady; when
thou seest her I entreat of thee to salute her on my behalf: but have
a care, when thou shalt see her and salute her, that thou kiss not her
face; for I shall be more jealous of thee than thou wert of that
light-footed ingrate that made thee sweat and run so on the plains of
Thessaly, or on the banks of the Peneus (for I do not exactly
recollect where it was thou didst run on that occasion) in thy
jealousy and love." Don Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech
when the landlady's daughter began to signal to him, saying, "Senor,
come over here, please." At these signals and voice Don Quixote turned
his head and saw by the light of the moon, which then was in its full
splendour, that some one was calling to him from the hole in the wall,
which seemed to him to be a window, and what is more, with a gilt
grating, as rich castles, such as he believed the inn to be, ought to
have; and it immediately suggested itself to his imagination that, as
on the former occasion, the fair damsel, the daughter of the lady of
the castle, overcome by love for him, was once more endeavouring to
win his affections; and with this idea, not to show himself
discourteous, or ungrateful, he turned Rocinante's head and approached
the hole, and as he perceived the two wenches he said: "I pity you,
beauteous lady, that you should have directed your thoughts of love to
a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return can be made
to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth, for which you
must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable
of submission to any other than her whom, the first moment his eyes
beheld her, he made absolute mistress of his soul. Forgive me, noble
lady, and retire to your apartment, and do not, by any further
declaration of your passion, compel me to show myself more ungrateful;
and if, of the love you bear me, you should find that there is
anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided it be
not love itself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by that sweet
absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be that you
require of me a lock of Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or even
the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial." "My mistress wants
nothing of that sort, sir knight," said Maritornes at this. "What
then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?" replied Don
Quixote. "Only one of your fair hands," said Maritornes, "to enable
her to vent over it the great passion passion which has brought her to
this loophole, so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her
father had heard her, the least slice he would cut off her would be
her ear." "I should like to see that tried," said Don Quixote; "but he
had better beware of that, if he does not want to meet the most
disastrous end that ever father in the world met for having laid hands
on the tender limbs of a love-stricken daughter." Maritornes felt sure
that Don Quixote would present the hand she had asked, and making up
her mind what to do, she got down from the hole and went into the
stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza's ass, and in all
haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had planted himself
standing on Rocinante's saddle in order to reach the grated window
where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving her his hand,
he said, "Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of the
evil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand of
woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of
my entire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but
that you may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network
of the muscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may
infer what must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand."
"That we shall see presently," said Maritornes, and making a running
knot on the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from
the hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the
straw-loft. Don Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his
wrist, exclaimed, "Your grace seems to be grating rather than
caressing my hand; treat it not so harshly, for it is not to blame for
the offence my resolution has given you, nor is it just to wreak all
your vengeance on so small a part; remember that one who loves so well
should not revenge herself so cruelly." But there was nobody now to
listen to these words of Don Quixote's, for as soon as Maritornes had
tied him she and the other made off, ready to die with laughing,
leaving him fastened in such a way that it was impossible for him to
release himself. He was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with
his arm passed through the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the
door, and in mighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if
Rocinante were to stir one side or the other; so he did not dare to
make the least movement, although from the patience and imperturbable
disposition of Rocinante, he had good reason to expect that he would
stand without budging for a whole century. Finding himself fast, then,
and that the ladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this was
done by enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same
castle that enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he
cursed in his heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to
enter the castle again, after having come off so badly the first time;
it being a settled point with knights-errant that when they have tried
an adventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is
not reserved for them but for others, and that therefore they need not
try it again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could
release himself, but it had been made so fast that all his efforts
were in vain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should
move, but try as he might to seat himself in the saddle, he had
nothing for it but to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was
he wished for the sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment
whatever had any power; then he cursed his ill fortune; then he
magnified the loss the world would sustain by his absence while he
remained there enchanted, for that he believed he was beyond all
doubt; then he once more took to thinking of his beloved Dulcinea del
Toboso; then he called to his worthy squire Sancho Panza, who, buried
in sleep and stretched upon the pack-saddle of his ass, was oblivious,
at that moment, of the mother that bore him; then he called upon the
sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to come to his aid; then he invoked his
good friend Urganda to succour him; and then, at last, morning found
him in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he was
bellowing like a bull, for he had no hope that day would bring any
relief to his suffering, which he believed would last for ever,
inasmuch as he was enchanted; and of this he was convinced by seeing
that Rocinante never stirred, much or little, and he felt persuaded
that he and his horse were to remain in this state, without eating or
drinking or sleeping, until the malign influence of the stars was
overpast, or until some other more sage enchanter should disenchant
him. But he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight
had hardly begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on
horseback, well equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their
saddle-bows. They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the
inn, which was still shut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there
where he was, did not forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud
and imperious tone, "Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have
no right to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough
that they who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the
habit of throwing open the fortress until the sun's rays are spread
over the whole surface of the earth. Withdraw to a distance, and wait
till it is broad daylight, and then we shall see whether it will be
proper or not to open to you." "What the devil fortress or castle is
this," said one, "to make us stand on such ceremony? If you are the
innkeeper bid them open to us; we are travellers who only want to feed
our horses and go on, for we are in haste." "Do you think, gentlemen,
that I look like an innkeeper?" said Don Quixote. "I don't know what
you look like," replied the other; "but I know that you are talking
nonsense when you call this inn a castle." "A castle it is," returned
Don Quixote, "nay, more, one of the best in this whole province, and
it has within it people who have had the sceptre in the hand and the
crown on the head." "It would be better if it were the other way,"
said the traveller, "the sceptre on the head and the crown in the
hand; but if so, may be there is within some company of players, with
whom it is a common thing to have those crowns and sceptres you speak
of; for in such a small inn as this, and where such silence is kept, I
do not believe any people entitled to crowns and sceptres can have
taken up their quarters." "You know but little of the world," returned
Don Quixote, "since you are ignorant of what commonly occurs in
knight-errantry." But the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of
the dialogue with Don Quixote, renewed their knocks with great
vehemence, so much so that the host, and not only he but everybody in
the inn, awoke, and he got up to ask who knocked. It happened at this
moment that one of the horses of the four who were seeking admittance
went to smell Rocinante, who melancholy, dejected, and with drooping
ears stood motionless, supporting his sorely stretched master; and as
he was, after all, flesh, though he looked as if he were made of wood,
he could not help giving way and in return smelling the one who had
come to offer him attentions. But he had hardly moved at all when Don
Quixote lost his footing; and slipping off the saddle, he would have
come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, which caused
him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut through
or his arm torn off; and he hung so near the ground that he could just
touch it with his feet, which was all the worse for him; for, finding
how little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly, he
struggled and stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing;
just like those undergoing the torture of the strappado, when they are
fixed at "touch and no touch," who aggravate their own sufferings by
their violent efforts to stretch themselves, deceived by the hope
which makes them fancy that with a very little more they will reach
the ground. CHAPTER XLIV. IN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE UNHEARD-OF
ADVENTURES OF THE INN So loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don
Quixote, that the landlord opening the gate of the inn in all haste,
came out in dismay, and ran to see who was uttering such cries, and
those who were outside joined him. Maritornes, who had been by this
time roused up by the same outcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the
loft and, without anyone seeing her, untied the halter by which Don
Quixote was suspended, and down he came to the ground in the sight of
the landlord and the travellers, who approaching asked him what was
the matter with him that he shouted so. He without replying a word
took the rope off his wrist, and rising to his feet leaped upon
Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and drawing his sword,
advanced to meet him; the duke with boar-spear did the same; but the
duchess would have gone in front of them all had not the duke
prevented her. Sancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of the
mighty beast, took to his heels as hard as he could and strove in vain
to mount a tall oak. As he was clinging to a branch, however, half-way
up in his struggle to reach the top, the bough, such was his ill-luck
and hard fate, gave way, and caught in his fall by a broken limb of
the oak, he hung suspended in the air unable to reach the ground.
Finding himself in this position, and that the green coat was
beginning to tear, and reflecting that if the fierce animal came that
way he might be able to get at him, he began to utter such cries, and
call for help so earnestly, that all who heard him and did not see him
felt sure he must be in the teeth of some wild beast. In the end the
tusked boar fell pierced by the blades of the many spears they held in
front of him; and Don Quixote, turning round at the cries of Sancho,
for he knew by them that it was he, saw him hanging from the oak head
downwards, with Dapple, who did not forsake him in his distress, close
beside him; and Cide Hamete observes that he seldom saw Sancho Panza
without seeing Dapple, or Dapple without seeing Sancho Panza; such was
their attachment and loyalty one to the other. Don Quixote went over
and unhooked Sancho, who, as soon as he found himself on the ground,
looked at the rent in his huntingcoat and was grieved to the heart,
for he thought he had got a patrimonial estate in that suit. Meanwhile
they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, and having
covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle, they bore
it away as the spoils of victory to some large field-tents which had
been pitched in the middle of the wood, where they found the tables
laid and dinner served, in such grand and sumptuous style that it was
easy to see the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it.
Sancho, as he showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess,
observed, "If we had been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat
would have been safe from being in the plight it's in; I don't know
what pleasure one can find in lying in wait for an animal that may
take your life with his tusk if he gets at you. I recollect having
heard an old ballad sung that says, By bears be thou devoured, as erst
Was famous Favila." "That," said Don Quixote, "was a Gothic king, who,
going a-hunting, was devoured by a bear." "Just so," said Sancho; "and
I would not have kings and princes expose themselves to such dangers
for the sake of a pleasure which, to my mind, ought not to be one, as
it consists in killing an animal that has done no harm whatever."
"Quite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there," said the duke; "for
hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than for
anybody else. The chase is the emblem of war; it has stratagems,
wiles, and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety; in it
extreme cold and intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence and
sleep are despised, the bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of
him who engages in it are made supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit
which may be followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to
many; and the best of it is, it is not for everybody, as field-sports
of other sorts are, except hawking, which also is only for kings and
great lords. Reconsider your opinion therefore, Sancho, and when you
are governor take to hunting, and you will find the good of it."
"Nay," said Sancho, "the good governor should have a broken leg and
keep at home; and the woman and the hen by gadding about are soon
lost; and she who is eager to see is also eager to be seen; I say no
more." The youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them
home, and they directed their steps towards the house, which was not
far off. On reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and
immediately a woman-servant who was waiting for them came down and
opened the door to them, and they went in, leaving the party
marvelling as much at their grace and beauty as at the fancy they had
for seeing the world by night and without quitting the village; which,
however, they set down to their youth. The head-carver was left with a
heart pierced through and through, and he made up his mind on the spot
to demand the damsel in marriage of her father on the morrow, making
sure she would not be refused him as he was a servant of the duke's;
and even to Sancho ideas and schemes of marrying the youth to his
daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and he resolved to open the
negotiation at the proper season, persuading himself that no husband
could be refused to a governor's daughter. And so the night's round
came to an end, and a couple of days later the government, whereby all
his plans were overthrown and swept away, as will be seen farther on.
CHAPTER L. WHEREIN IS SET FORTH WHO THE ENCHANTERS AND EXECUTIONERS
WERE WHO FLOGGED THE DUENNA AND PINCHED DON QUIXOTE, AND ALSO WHAT
BEFELL THE PAGE WHO CARRIED THE LETTER TO TERESA PANZA, SANCHO PANZA'S
WIFE CHAPTER LI OF THE PROGRESS OF SANCHO'S GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER SUCH
ENTERTAINING MATTERS Day came after the night of the governor's round;
a night which the head-carver passed without sleeping, so were his
thoughts of the face and air and beauty of the disguised damsel, while
the majordomo spent what was left of it in writing an account to his
lord and lady of all Sancho said and did, being as much amazed at his
sayings as at his doings, for there was a mixture of shrewdness and
simplicity in all his words and deeds. The senor governor got up, and
by Doctor Pedro Recio's directions they made him break his fast on a
little conserve and four sups of cold water, which Sancho would have
readily exchanged for a piece of bread and a bunch of grapes; but
seeing there was no help for it, he submitted with no little sorrow of
heart and discomfort of stomach; Pedro Recio having persuaded him that
light and delicate diet enlivened the wits, and that was what was most
essential for persons placed in command and in responsible situations,
where they have to employ not only the bodily powers but those of the
mind also. By means of this sophistry Sancho was made to endure
hunger, and hunger so keen that in his heart he cursed the government,
and even him who had given it to him; however, with his hunger and his
conserve he undertook to deliver judgments that day, and the first
thing that came before him was a question that was submitted to him by
a stranger, in the presence of the majordomo and the other attendants,
and it was in these words: "Senor, a large river separated two
districts of one and the same lordship--will your worship please to
pay attention, for the case is an important and a rather knotty one?
Well then, on this river there was a bridge, and at one end of it a
gallows, and a sort of tribunal, where four judges commonly sat to
administer the law which the lord of river, bridge and the lordship
had enacted, and which was to this effect, 'If anyone crosses by this
bridge from one side to the other he shall declare on oath where he is
going to and with what object; and if he swears truly, he shall be
allowed to pass, but if falsely, he shall be put to death for it by
hanging on the gallows erected there, without any remission.' Though
the law and its severe penalty were known, many persons crossed, but
in their declarations it was easy to see at once they were telling the
truth, and the judges let them pass free. It happened, however, that
one man, when they came to take his declaration, swore and said that
by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood
there, and nothing else. The judges held a consultation over the oath,
and they said, 'If we let this man pass free he has sworn falsely, and
by the same law deserves to be hanged." "It is as the senor governor
says," said the messenger; "and as regards a complete comprehension of
the case, there is nothing left to desire or hesitate about." "Well
then I say," said Sancho, "that of this man they should let pass the
part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in
this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with."
"But then, senor governor," replied the querist, "the man will have to
be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die;
and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it
is absolutely necessary to comply with it." "Look here, my good sir,"
said Sancho; "either I'm a numskull or else there is the same reason
for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the
bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him;
and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the
gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him
and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass
freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil;
this I would give signed with my name if I knew how to sign; and what
I have said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of the
many precepts my master Don Quixote gave me the night before I left to
become governor of this island, that came into my mind, and it was
this, that when there was any doubt about the justice of a case I
should lean to mercy; and it is God's will that I should recollect it
now, for it fits this case as if it was made for it." "That is true,"
said the majordomo; "and I maintain that Lycurgus himself, who gave
laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have pronounced a better decision
than the great Panza has given; let the morning's audience close with
this, and I will see that the senor governor has dinner entirely to
his liking." "That's all I ask for--fair play," said Sancho; "give me
my dinner, and then let it rain cases and questions on me, and I'll
despatch them in a twinkling." The majordomo kept his word, for he
felt it against his conscience to kill so wise a governor by hunger;
particularly as he intended to have done with him that same night,
playing off the last joke he was commissioned to practise upon him. It
came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in opposition to
the rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were taking
away the cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote for
the governor. Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and
if there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. The
secretary did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, "It
may well be read aloud, for what Senor Don Quixote writes to your
worship deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it
is as follows." DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA'S LETTER TO SANCHO PANZA,
GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND OF BARATARIA. When I was expecting to hear of
thy stupidities and blunders, friend Sancho, I have received
intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for which I give special
thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the dunghill and of
fools to make wise men. They tell me thou dost govern as if thou wert
a man, and art a man as if thou wert a beast, so great is the humility
wherewith thou dost comport thyself. But I would have thee bear in
mind, Sancho, that very often it is fitting and necessary for the
authority of office to resist the humility of the heart; for the
seemly array of one who is invested with grave duties should be such
as they require and not measured by what his own humble tastes may
lead him to prefer. Dress well; a stick dressed up does not look like
a stick; I do not say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment, or
that being a judge thou shouldst dress like a soldier, but that thou
shouldst array thyself in the apparel thy office requires, and that at
the same time it be neat and handsome. To win the good-will of the
people thou governest there are two things, among others, that thou
must do; one is to be civil to all (this, however, I told thee
before), and the other to take care that food be abundant, for there
is nothing that vexes the heart of the poor more than hunger and high
prices. Make not many proclamations; but those thou makest take care
that they be good ones, and above all that they be observed and
carried out; for proclamations that are not observed are the same as
if they did not exist; nay, they encourage the idea that the prince
who had the wisdom and authority to make them had not the power to
enforce them; and laws that threaten and are not enforced come to be
like the log, the king of the frogs, that frightened them at first,
but that in time they despised and mounted upon. Be a father to virtue
and a stepfather to vice. Be not always strict, nor yet always
lenient, but observe a mean between these two extremes, for in that is
the aim of wisdom. Visit the gaols, the slaughter-houses, and the
market-places; for the presence of the governor is of great importance
in such places; it comforts the prisoners who are in hopes of a speedy
release, it is the bugbear of the butchers who have then to give just
weight, and it is the terror of the market-women for the same reason.
Let it not be seen that thou art (even if perchance thou art, which I
do not believe) covetous, a follower of women, or a glutton; for when
the people and those that have dealings with thee become aware of thy
special weakness they will bring their batteries to bear upon thee in
that quarter, till they have brought thee down to the depths of
perdition. Consider and reconsider, con and con over again the advices
and the instructions I gave thee before thy departure hence to thy
government, and thou wilt see that in them, if thou dost follow them,
thou hast a help at hand that will lighten for thee the troubles and
difficulties that beset governors at every step. Write to thy lord and
lady and show thyself grateful to them, for ingratitude is the
daughter of pride, and one of the greatest sins we know of; and he who
is grateful to those who have been good to him shows that he will be
so to God also who has bestowed and still bestows so many blessings
upon him. My lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and
another present to thy wife Teresa Panza; we expect the answer every
moment. I have been a little indisposed through a certain scratching I
came in for, not very much to the benefit of my nose; but it was
nothing; for if there are enchanters who maltreat me, there are also
some who defend me. Let me know if the majordomo who is with thee had
any share in the Trifaldi performance, as thou didst suspect; and keep
me informed of everything that happens thee, as the distance is so
short; all the more as I am thinking of giving over very shortly this
idle life I am now leading, for I was not born for it. A thing has
occurred to me which I am inclined to think will put me out of favour
with the duke and duchess; but though I am sorry for it I do not care,
for after all I must obey my calling rather than their pleasure, in
accordance with the common saying, amicus Plato, sed magis amica
veritas. I quote this Latin to thee because I conclude that since thou
hast been a governor thou wilt have learned it. Adieu; God keep thee
from being an object of pity to anyone. Thy friend, DON QUIXOTE OF LA
MANCHA. Sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was
praised and considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from
table, and calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own
room, and without putting it off any longer set about answering his
master Don Quixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what
he told him without adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and
the answer was to the following effect. SANCHO PANZA'S LETTER TO DON
QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA. The pressure of business is so great upon me
that I have no time to scratch my head or even to cut my nails; and I
have them so long-God send a remedy for it. I say this, master of my
soul, that you may not be surprised if I have not until now sent you
word of how I fare, well or ill, in this government, in which I am
suffering more hunger than when we two were wandering through the
woods and wastes. My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn
me that certain spies had got into this island to kill me; but up to
the present I have not heard of any defamatory verse against the Lady
Angelica, who turned the world upside down." "Strange," said the
curate; but at this moment they heard the housekeeper and the niece,
who had previously withdrawn from the conversation, exclaiming aloud
in the courtyard, and at the noise they all ran out. CHAPTER II. WHICH
TREATS OF THE NOTABLE ALTERCATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HAD WITH DON
QUIXOTE'S NIECE, AND HOUSEKEEPER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DROLL MATTERS
The history relates that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and the
barber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to
Sancho, who was striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote while
they held the door against him, "What does the vagabond want in this
house? Be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else,
that delude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping
about the country." To which Sancho replied, "Devil's own housekeeper!
it is I who am deluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the
country, and not thy master! He has carried me all over the world, and
you are mightily mistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick,
promising me an island, which I am still waiting for." "May evil
islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho," said the niece; "What are
islands? Is it something to eat, glutton and gormandiser that thou
art?" "It is not something to eat," replied Sancho, "but something to
govern and rule, and better than four cities or four judgeships at
court." "For all that," said the housekeeper, "you don't enter here,
you bag of mischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig
your seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands." The
curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of
the three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt
out a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points
that might not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the
other two hold their tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and
the curate and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose
recovery they despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy
ideas, and how saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry;
and said the curate to the barber, "You will see, gossip, that when we
are least thinking of it, our gentleman will be off once more for
another flight." "I have no doubt of it," returned the barber; "but I
do not wonder so much at the madness of the knight as at the
simplicity of the squire, who has such a firm belief in all that about
the island, that I suppose all the exposures that could be imagined
would not get it out of his head." "God help them," said the curate;
"and let us be on the look-out to see what comes of all these
absurdities of the knight and squire, for it seems as if they had both
been cast in the same mould, and the madness of the master without the
simplicity of the man would not be worth a farthing." "That is true,"
said the barber, "and I should like very much to know what the pair
are talking about at this moment." "I promise you," said the curate,
"the niece or the housekeeper will tell us by-and-by, for they are not
the ones to forget to listen." Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up
in his room with Sancho, and when they were alone he said to him, "It
grieves me greatly, Sancho, that thou shouldst have said, and sayest,
that I took thee out of thy cottage, when thou knowest I did not
remain in my house. We sallied forth together, we took the road
together, we wandered abroad together; we have had the same fortune
and the same luck; if they blanketed thee once, they belaboured me a
hundred times, and that is the only advantage I have of thee." "That
was only reasonable," replied Sancho, "for, by what your worship says,
misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant than to their
squires." "Thou art mistaken, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "according to
the maxim quando caput dolet, etc." "I don't understand any language
but my own," said Sancho. "I mean to say," said Don Quixote, "that
when the head suffers all the members suffer; and so, being thy lord
and master, I am thy head, and thou a part of me as thou art my
servant; and therefore any evil that affects or shall affect me should
give thee pain, and what affects thee give pain to me." "It should be
so," said Sancho; "but when I was blanketed as a member, my head was
on the other side of the wall, looking on while I was flying through
the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if the members are
obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it should be obliged to
feel their sufferings." "Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho," said Don
Quixote, "that I did not feel when they were blanketing thee? If thou
dost, thou must not say so or think so, for I felt more pain then in
spirit than thou didst in body. But let us put that aside for the
present, for we shall have opportunities enough for considering and
settling the point; tell me, Sancho my friend, what do they say about
me in the village here? What do the common people think of me? What do
the hidalgos? What do the caballeros? What do they say of my valour;
of my achievements; of my courtesy? How do they treat the task I have
undertaken in reviving and restoring to the world the now forgotten
order of chivalry? In short, Sancho, I would have thee tell me all
that has come to thine ears on this subject; and thou art to tell me,
without adding anything to the good or taking away anything from the
bad; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to tell the truth to their
lords just as it is and in its proper shape, not allowing flattery to
add to it or any idle deference to lessen it. And I would have thee
know, Sancho, that if the naked truth, undisguised by flattery, came
to the ears of princes, times would be different, and other ages would
be reckoned iron ages more than ours, which I hold to be the golden of
these latter days. Profit by this advice, Sancho, and report to me
clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest touching what I
have demanded of thee." "That I will do with all my heart, senor,"
said Sancho; "and let us return to our village with these gentlemen,
who seek your good, and there we will prepare for making another
sally, which may turn out more profitable and creditable to us." "Thou
art right, Sancho," returned Don Quixote; "It will be wise to let the
malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off." The canon,
the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing
as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza's simplicities, they
placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The procession once more
formed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took
his leave of the party; the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go
any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon
begged the curate to let him know how Don Quixote did, whether he was
cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and then begged leave
to continue his journey; in short, they all separated and went their
ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the barber, Don Quixote,
Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded everything with as
great resignation as his master. The carter yoked his oxen and made
Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual deliberate
pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six days
they reached Don Quixote's village, and entered it about the middle of
the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the people were all in
the plaza, through which Don Quixote's cart passed. They all flocked
to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised their townsman
they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news
to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come
back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an
ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised,
how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those
accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don
Quixote coming in at the gate. At the news of Don Quixote's arrival
Sancho Panza's wife came running, for she by this time knew that her
husband had gone away with him as his squire, and on seeing Sancho,
the first thing she asked him was if the ass was well. Sancho replied
that he was, better than his master was. "Thanks be to God," said she,
"for being so good to me; but now tell me, my friend, what have you
made by your squirings? What gown have you brought me back? What shoes
for your children?" "I bring nothing of that sort, wife," said Sancho;
"though I bring other things of more consequence and value." "I am
very glad of that," returned his wife; "show me these things of more
value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my
heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been
away." "I will show them to you at home, wife," said Sancho; "be
content for the present; for if it please God that we should again go
on our travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count,
or governor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but
the best that is to be had." "Heaven grant it, husband," said she,
"for indeed we have need of it. But tell me, what's this about
islands, for I don't understand it?" "Honey is not for the mouth of
the ass," returned Sancho; "all in good time thou shalt see,
wife--nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself called 'your
ladyship' by all thy vassals." "What are you talking about, Sancho,
with your ladyships, islands, and vassals?" returned Teresa Panza--for
so Sancho's wife was called, though they were not relations, for in La
Mancha it is customary for wives to take their husbands' surnames.
"Don't be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa," said Sancho; "it
is enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I
may tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world
more delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a
knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those
one finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a
hundred, ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by
experience, for out of some I came blanketed, and out of others
belaboured. Still, for all that, it is a fine thing to be on the
look-out for what may happen, crossing mountains, searching woods,
climbing rocks, visiting castles, putting up at inns, all at free
quarters, and devil take the maravedi to pay." While this conversation
passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don Quixote's housekeeper
and niece took him in and undressed him and laid him in his old bed.
He eyed them askance, and could not make out where he was. The curate
charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle comfortable and
to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape from them
again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring him home.
On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their
maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to plunge
the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless
pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle
and master should give them the slip the moment he found himself
somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out. But the author of
this history, though he has devoted research and industry to the
discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his third sally, has
been unable to obtain any information respecting them, at any rate
derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely preserved in
the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the third time he
sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa, where he was
present at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and that he
had adventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence. Of
his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor would he have
ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old
physician for him who had in his possession a leaden box, which,
according to his account, had been discovered among the crumbling
foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which
box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but
in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements, and setting
forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of
Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself, together with
sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character; but all that
could be read and deciphered were those which the trustworthy author
of this new and unparalleled history here presents. And the said
author asks of those that shall read it nothing in return for the vast
toil which it has cost him in examining and searching the Manchegan
archives in order to bring it to light, save that they give him the
same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry that
pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he will consider
himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged to seek
out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least equal in
invention and not less entertaining. The first words written on the
parchment found in the leaden box were these: THE ACADEMICIANS OF
ARGAMASILLA, A VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA, ON THE LIFE AND DEATH OF DON
QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA, HOC SCRIPSERUNT MONICONGO, ACADEMICIAN OF
ARGAMASILLA, ON THE TOMB OF DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO EPITAPH Here Dulcinea
lies. Plump was she and robust: Now she is ashes and dust: The end of
all flesh that dies. A lady of high degree, With the port of a lofty
dame, And the great Don Quixote's flame, And the pride of her village
was she. These were all the verses that could be deciphered; the rest,
the writing being worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the
Academicians to make out their meaning conjecturally. We have been
informed that at the cost of many sleepless nights and much toil he
has succeeded, and that he means to publish them in hopes of Don
Quixote's third sally. "Forse altro cantera con miglior plectro." END

very much to know what the pair are talking about at this moment." "I
promise you," said the curate, "the niece or the housekeeper will tell
us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to listen."
Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and
when they were alone he said to him, "It grieves me greatly, Sancho,
that thou shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy
cottage, when thou knowest I did not remain in my house. We sallied
forth together, we took the road together, we wandered abroad
together; we have had the same fortune and the same luck; if they
blanketed thee once, they belaboured me a hundred times, and that is
the only advantage I have of thee." "That was only reasonable,"
replied Sancho, "for, by what your worship says, misfortunes belong
more properly to knights-errant than to their squires." "Thou art
mistaken, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "according to the maxim quando
caput dolet, etc." "I don't understand any language but my own," said
Sancho. "I mean to say," said Don Quixote, "that when the head suffers
all the members suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, I am thy
head, and thou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any
evil that affects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what
affects thee give pain to me." "It should be so," said Sancho; "but
when I was blanketed as a member, my head was on the other side of the
wall, looking on while I was flying through the air, and did not feel
any pain whatever; and if the members are obliged to feel the
suffering of the head, it should be obliged to feel their sufferings."
"Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "that I did not
feel when they were blanketing thee? If thou dost, thou must not say
so or think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in
body. But let us put that aside for the present, for we shall have
opportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,
Sancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? What
do the common people think of me? What do the hidalgos? What do the
caballeros? What do they say of my valour; of my achievements; of my
courtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and
restoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short,
Sancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on
this subject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the
good or taking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal
vassals to tell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its
proper shape, not allowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference
to lessen it. And I would have thee know, Sancho, that there are two
kinds of lineages in the world; some there be tracing and deriving
their descent from kings and princes, whom time has reduced little by
little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down; and
others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step
until they come to be great lords; so that the difference is that the
one were what they no longer are, and the others are what they
formerly were not. And I may be of such that after investigation my
origin may prove great and famous, with which the king, my
father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and should he not
be, the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to
be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her lord and
husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to seizing her
and carrying her off where I please; for time or death will put an end
to the wrath of her parents." "It comes to this, too," said Sancho,
"what some naughty people say, 'Never ask as a favour what thou canst
take by force;' though it would fit better to say, 'A clear escape is
better than good men's prayers.' I say so because if my lord the king,
your worship's father-in-law, will not condescend to give you my lady
the princess, there is nothing for it but, as your worship says, to
seize her and transport her. But the mischief is that until peace is
made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of your kingdom, the
poor squire is famishing as far as rewards go, unless it be that the
confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes with the princess, and
that with her he tides over his bad luck until Heaven otherwise orders
things; for his master, I suppose, may as well give her to him at once
for a lawful wife." "Nobody can object to that," said Don Quixote.
"Then since that may be," said Sancho, "there is nothing for it but to
commend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will."
"God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants," said Don Quixote,
"and mean be he who thinks himself mean." "In God's name let him be
so," said Sancho: "I am an old Christian, and to fit me for a count
that's enough." "And more than enough for thee," said Don Quixote;
"and even wert thou not, it would make no difference, because I being
the king can easily give thee nobility without purchase or service
rendered by thee, for when I make thee a count, then thou art at once
a gentleman; and they may say what they will, but by my faith they
will have to call thee 'your lordship,' whether they like it or not."
"Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to support the tittle," said
Sancho. "Title thou shouldst say, not tittle," said his master. "So be
it," answered Sancho. "I say I will know how to behave, for once in my
life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so well
on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same
brotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my
back, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe
they'll come a hundred leagues to see me." "Thou wilt look well," said
Don Quixote, "but thou must shave thy beard often, for thou hast it so
thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dost not shave it every
second day at least, they will see what thou art at the distance of a
musket shot." "What more will it be," said Sancho, "than having a
barber, and keeping him at wages in the house? and even if it be
necessary, I will make him go behind me like a nobleman's equerry."
"Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?"
asked Don Quixote. "I will tell you," answered Sancho. "Years ago I
was for a month at the capital and there I saw taking the air a very
small gentleman who they said was a very great man, and a man
following him on horseback in every turn he took, just as if he was
his tail. I asked why this man did not join the other man, instead of
always going behind him; they answered me that he was his equerry, and
that it was the custom with nobles to have such persons behind them,
and ever since then I know it, for I have never forgotten it." "Thou
art right," said Don Quixote, "and I cannot guess or explain what this
may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is
anything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what
we want to know." He opened it, and the first thing he found in it,
written roughly but in a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it
aloud that Sancho might hear it, he found that it ran as follows:
SONNET Or Love is lacking in intelligence, Or to the height of cruelty
attains, Or else it is my doom to suffer pains Beyond the measure due
to my offence. But if Love be a God, it follows thence That he knows
all, and certain it remains No God loves cruelty; then who ordains
This penance that enthrals while it torments? It were a falsehood,
Chloe, thee to name; Such evil with such goodness cannot live; And
against Heaven I dare not charge the blame, I only know it is my fate
to die. To him who knows not whence his malady A miracle alone a cure
can give. "There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme," said
Sancho, "unless by that clue there's in it, one may draw out the ball
of the whole matter." "What clue is there?" said Don Quixote. "I
thought your worship spoke of a clue in it," said Sancho. "I only said
Chloe," replied Don Quixote; "and that no doubt, is the name of the
lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and, faith, he must
be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft." "Then your
worship understands rhyming too?" "And better than thou thinkest,"
replied Don Quixote, "as thou shalt see when thou carriest a letter
written in verse from beginning to end to my lady Dulcinea del Toboso,
for I would have thee know, Sancho, if thou knowest it not, that with
lovers the outward actions and motions they give way to when their
loves are in question are the faithful messengers that carry the news
of what is going on in the depths of their hearts. Go, my friend, may
better fortune than mine attend thee, and bring thee a happier issue
than that which I await in dread in this dreary solitude." "I will go
and return quickly," said Sancho; "cheer up that little heart of
yours, master mine, for at the present moment you seem to have got one
no bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say, that a stout heart
breaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletches there are no
pegs; and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it's not looked
for. I say this because, if we could not find my lady's palaces or
castles to-night, now that it is daylight I count upon finding them
when I least expect it, and once found, leave it to me to manage her."
"Verily, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "thou dost always bring in thy
proverbs happily, whatever we deal with; may God give me better luck
in what I am anxious about." With this, Sancho wheeled about and gave
Dapple the stick, and Don Quixote remained behind, seated on his
horse, resting in his stirrups and leaning on the end of his lance,
filled with sad and troubled forebodings; and there we will leave him,
and accompany Sancho, who went off no less serious and troubled than
he left his master; so much so, that as soon as he had got out of the
thicket, and looking round saw that Don Quixote was not within sight,
he dismounted from his ass, and seating himself at the foot of a tree
began to commune with himself, saying, "Now, brother Sancho, let us
know where your worship is going. Are you going to look for some ass
that has been lost? Not at all. Then what are you going to look for? I
am going to look for a princess, that's all; and in her for the sun of
beauty and the whole heaven at once. And where do you expect to find
all this, Sancho? Where? Why, in the great city of El Toboso. Well,
and for whom are you going to look for her? For the famous knight Don
Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess that my Casildea is more
beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one victory I hold myself to
have conquered all the knights in the world; for this Don Quixote that
I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having vanquished him, his
glory, his fame, and his honour have passed and are transferred to my
person; for The more the vanquished hath of fair renown, The greater
glory gilds the victor's crown. Thus the innumerable achievements of
the said Don Quixote are now set down to my account and have become
mine." Don Quixote was amazed when he heard the Knight of the Grove,
and was a thousand times on the point of telling him he lied, and had
the lie direct already on the tip of his tongue; but he restrained
himself as well as he could, in order to force him to confess the lie
with his own lips; so he said to him quietly, "As to what you say, sir
knight, about having vanquished most of the knights of Spain, or even
of the whole world, I say nothing; but that you have vanquished Don
Quixote of La Mancha I consider doubtful; it may have been some other
that resembled him, although there are few like him." "How! not
vanquished?" said he of the Grove; "by the heaven that is above us I
fought Don Quixote and overcame him and made him yield; and he is a
man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with hair
turning grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black drooping
moustaches; he does battle under the name of 'The Countenance,' and he
has for squire a peasant called Sancho Panza; he presses the loins and
rules the reins of a famous steed called Rocinante; and lastly, he has
for the mistress of his will a certain Dulcinea del Toboso, once upon
a time called Aldonza Lorenzo, just as I call mine Casildea de
Vandalia because her name is Casilda and she is of Andalusia. If all
these tokens are not enough to vindicate the truth of what I say, here
is Don Quixote himself, who will maintain it by arms, on foot or on
horseback or in any way you please." And so saying he stood up and
laid his hand on his sword, waiting to see what the Knight of the
Grove would do, who in an equally calm voice said in reply, "Pledges
don't distress a good payer; he who has succeeded in vanquishing you
once when transformed, Sir Don Quixote, may fairly hope to subdue you
in your own proper shape; but as it is not becoming for knights to
perform their feats of arms in the dark, like highwaymen and bullies,
let us wait till daylight, that the sun may behold our deeds; and the
conditions of our combat shall be that the vanquished shall be at the
victor's disposal, to do all that he may enjoin, provided the
injunction be such as shall be becoming a knight." "I am more than
satisfied with these conditions and terms," replied Don Quixote; and
so saying, they betook themselves to where their squires lay, and
found them snoring, and in the same posture they were in when sleep
fell upon them. They roused them up, and bade them get the horses
ready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduous
single combat; at which intelligence Sancho was aghast and
thunderstruck, trembling for the safety of his master because of the
mighty deeds he had heard the squire of the Grove ascribe to his; but
without a word the two squires went in quest of their cattle; for by
this time the three horses and the ass had smelt one another out, and
were all together. On the way, he of the Grove said to Sancho, "A hard
life it is we lead and live, senor, we that are squires to
knights-errant; verily, we eat our bread in the sweat of our faces,
which is one of the curses God laid on our first parents." "It may be
said, too," added Sancho, "that we eat it in the chill of our bodies;
for who gets more heat and cold than the miserable squires of
knight-errantry? Even so it would not be so bad if we had something to
eat, for woes are lighter if there's bread; but sometimes we go a day
or two without breaking our fast, except with the wind that blows."
"All that," said he of the Grove, "may be endured and put up with when
we have hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant he serves is
excessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least find
himself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some fair
county." "I," said Sancho, "have already told my master that I shall
be content with the government of some island, and he is so noble and
generous that he has promised it to me ever so many times." "I," said
he of the Grove, "shall be satisfied with a canonry for my services,
and my master has already assigned me one." "Your master," said
Sancho, "no doubt is a knight in the Church line, and can bestow
rewards of that sort on his good squire; but mine is only a layman;
though I remember some clever, but, to my mind, designing people,
strove to persuade him to try and become an archbishop. He, however,
would not be anything but an emperor; but I was trembling all the time
lest he should take a fancy to go into the Church, not finding myself
fit to hold office in it; for I may tell you, though I seem a man, I
am no better than a beast for the Church." "Well, then, you are wrong
there," said he of the Grove; "for those island governments are not
all satisfactory; some are awkward, some are poor, some are dull, and,
in short, the highest and choicest brings with it a heavy burden of
cares and troubles which the unhappy wight to whose lot it has fallen
bears upon his shoulders. Far better would it be for us who have
adopted this accursed service to go back to our own houses, and there
employ ourselves in pleasanter occupations--in hunting or fishing, for
instance; for what squire in the world is there so poor as not to have
a hack and a couple of greyhounds and a fishingrod to amuse himself
with in his own village?" "I am not in want of any of those things,"
said Sancho; "to be sure I have no hack, but I have an ass that is
worth my master's horse twice over; God send me a bad Easter, and that
the next one I am to see, if I would swap, even if I got four bushels
of barley to boot. You will laugh at the value I put on my Dapple--for
dapple is the colour of my beast. As to greyhounds, I can't want for
them, for there are enough and to spare in my town; and, moreover,
there is more pleasure in sport when it is at other people's expense."
"In truth and earnest, sir squire," said he of the Grove, "I have made
up my mind and determined to have done with these drunken vagaries of
these knights, and go back to my village, and bring up my children;
for I have three, like three Oriental pearls." "I have two," said
Sancho, "that might be presented before the Pope himself, especially a
girl whom I am breeding up for a countess, please God, though in spite
of her mother." "And how old is this lady that is being bred up for a
countess?" asked he of the Grove. "Fifteen, a couple of years more or
less," answered Sancho; "but she is as tall as a lance, and as fresh
as an April morning, and as strong as a porter." "Those are gifts to
fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of the greenwood," said
he of the Grove; "whoreson strumpet! what pith the rogue must have!"
To which Sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, "She's no strumpet, nor
was her mother, nor will either of them be, please God, while I live;
speak more civilly; for one bred up among knights-errant, who are
courtesy itself, your words don't seem to me to be very becoming." "O
how little you know about compliments, sir squire," returned he of the
Grove. "What! don't you know that when a horseman delivers a good
lance thrust at the bull in the plaza, or when anyone does anything
very well, the people are wont to say, 'Ha, whoreson rip! how well he
has done it!' and that what seems to be abuse in the expression is
high praise? Disown sons and daughters, senor, who don't do what
deserves that compliments of this sort should be paid to their
parents." "I do disown them," replied Sancho, "and in this way, and by
the same reasoning, you might call me and my children and my wife all
the strumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind that
in the highest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again
I pray God to deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the same
thing, to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which I
have fallen a second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with a
hundred ducats that I found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena;
and the devil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my
eyes, here, there, everywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am
putting my hand on it, and hugging it, and carrying it home with me,
and making investments, and getting interest, and living like a
prince; and so long as I think of this I make light of all the
hardships I endure with this simpleton of a master of mine, who, I
well know, is more of a madman than a knight." "There's why they say
that 'covetousness bursts the bag,'" said he of the Grove; "but if you
come to talk of that sort, there is not a greater one in the world
than my master, for he is one of those of whom they say, 'the cares of
others kill the ass;' for, in order that another knight may recover
the senses he has lost, he makes a madman of himself and goes looking
for what, when found, may, for all I know, fly in his own face." "And
is he in love perchance?" asked Sancho. "He is," said of the Grove,
"with one Casildea de Vandalia, the rawest and best roasted lady the
whole world could produce; but that rawness is not the only foot he
limps on, for he has greater schemes rumbling in his bowels, as will
be seen before many hours are over." "There's no road so smooth but it
has some hole or hindrance in it," said Sancho; "in other houses they
cook beans, but in mine it's by the potful; madness will have more
followers and hangers-on than sound sense; but if there be any truth
in the common saying, that to have companions in trouble gives some
relief, I may take consolation from you, inasmuch as you serve a
master as crazy as my own." "Crazy but valiant," replied he of the
Grove, "and more roguish than crazy or valiant." "Mine is not that,"
said Sancho; "I mean he has nothing of the rogue in him; on the
contrary, he has the soul of a pitcher; he has no thought of doing
harm to anyone, only good to all, nor has he any malice whatever in
him; a child might persuade him that it is night at noonday; and for
this simplicity I love him as the core of my heart, and I can't bring
myself to leave him, let him do ever such foolish things." "For all
that, brother and senor," said he of the Grove, "if the blind lead the
blind, both are in danger of falling into the pit. It is better for us
to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our own quarters; for those
who seek adventures don't always find good ones." Sancho kept spitting
from time to time, and his spittle seemed somewhat ropy and dry,
observing which the compassionate squire of the Grove said, "It seems
to me that with all this talk of ours our tongues are sticking to the
roofs of our mouths; but I have a pretty good loosener hanging from
the saddle-bow of my horse," and getting up he came back the next
minute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yard across; and
this is no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbit so big that
Sancho, as he handled it, took it to be made of a goat, not to say a
kid, and looking at it he said, "And do you carry this with you,
senor?" "Why, what are you thinking about?" said the other; "do you
take me for some paltry squire? I carry a better larder on my horse's
croup than a general takes with him when he goes on a march." Sancho
ate without requiring to be pressed, and in the dark bolted mouthfuls
like the knots on a tether, and said he, "You are a proper trusty
squire, one of the right sort, sumptuous and grand, as this banquet
shows, which, if it has not come here by magic art, at any rate has
the look of it; not like me, unlucky beggar, that have nothing more in
my alforjas than a scrap of cheese, so hard that one might brain a
giant with it, and, to keep it company, a few dozen carobs and as many
more filberts and walnuts; thanks to the austerity of my master, and
the idea he has and the rule he follows, that knights-errant must not
live or sustain themselves on anything except dried fruits and the
herbs of the field." "By my faith, brother," said he of the Grove, "my
stomach is not made for thistles, or wild pears, or roots of the
woods; let our masters do as they like, with their chivalry notions
and laws, and eat what those enjoin; I carry my prog-basket and this
bota hanging to the saddle-bow, whatever they may say; and it is such
an object of worship with me, and I love it so, that there is hardly a
moment but I am kissing and embracing it over and over again;" and so
saying he thrust it into Sancho's hands, who raising it aloft pointed
to his mouth, gazed at the stars for a quarter of an hour; and when he
had done drinking let his head fall on one side, and giving a deep
sigh, exclaimed, "Ah, whoreson rogue, how catholic it is!" "There, you
see," said he of the Grove, hearing Sancho's exclamation, "how you
have called this wine whoreson by way of praise." "Well," said Sancho,
"I own it, and I grant it is no dishonour to call anyone whoreson when
it is to be understood as praise. But tell me, senor, by what you love
best, is this Ciudad Real wine?" "O rare wine-taster!" said he of the
Grove; "nowhere else indeed does it come from, and it has some years'
age too." "Leave me alone for that," said Sancho; "never fear but I'll
hit upon the place it came from somehow. What would you say, sir
squire, to my having such a great natural instinct in judging wines
that you have only to let me smell one and I can tell positively its
country, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will
undergo, and everything that appertains to a wine? But it is no
wonder, for I have had in my family, on my father's side, the two best
wine-tasters that have been known in La Mancha for many a long year,
and to prove it I'll tell you now a thing that happened them. They
gave the two of them some wine out of a cask, to try, asking their
opinion as to the condition, quality, goodness or badness of the wine.
One of them tried it with the tip of his tongue, the other did no more
than bring it to his nose. The first said the wine had a flavour of
iron, the second said it had a stronger flavour of cordovan. The owner
said the cask was clean, and that nothing had been added to the wine
from which it could have got a flavour of either iron or leather.
Nevertheless, these two great wine-tasters held to what they had said.
Time went by, the wine was sold, and when they came to clean out the
cask, they found in it a small key hanging to a thong of cordovan; see
now if one who comes of the same stock has not a right to give his
opinion in such like cases." "Therefore, I say," said he of the Grove,
"let us give up going in quest of adventures, and as we have loaves
let us not go looking for cakes, but return to our cribs, for God will
find us there if it be his will." "Until my master reaches Saragossa,"
said Sancho, "I'll remain in his service; after that we'll see." The
end of it was that the licentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every
one of the buttons of the short cassock he wore, tore the skirts into
strips, like the tails of a cuttlefish, knocked off his hat twice, and
so completely tired him out, that in vexation, anger, and rage, he
took the sword by the hilt and flung it away with such force, that one
of the peasants that were there, who was a notary, and who went for
it, made an affidavit afterwards that he sent it nearly three-quarters
of a league, which testimony will serve, and has served, to show and
establish with all certainty that strength is overcome by skill.
Corchuelo sat down wearied, and Sancho approaching him said, "By my
faith, senor bachelor, if your worship takes my advice, you will never
challenge anyone to fence again, only to wrestle and throw the bar,
for you have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers
as they call them, I have heard say they can put the point of a sword
through the eye of a needle." "I am satisfied with having tumbled off
my donkey," said Corchuelo, "and with having had the truth I was so
ignorant of proved to me by experience;" and getting up he embraced
the licentiate, and they were better friends than ever; and not caring
to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword, as they saw he
would be a long time about it, they resolved to push on so as to reach
the village of Quiteria, to which they all belonged, in good time.
During the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them
on the excellences of the sword, with such conclusive arguments, and
such figures and mathematical proofs, that all were convinced of the
value of the science, and Corchuelo cured of his dogmatism. It grew
dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as if
there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it.
They heard, too, the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of
instruments, flutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels,
and as they drew near they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade
that had been constructed at the entrance of the town were filled with
lights unaffected by the wind, for the breeze at the time was so
gentle that it had not power to stir the leaves on the trees. The
musicians were the life of the wedding, wandering through the pleasant
grounds in separate bands, some dancing, others singing, others
playing the various instruments already mentioned. In short, it seemed
as though mirth and gaiety were frisking and gambolling all over the
meadow. Several other persons were engaged in erecting raised benches
from which people might conveniently see the plays and dances that
were to be performed the next day on the spot dedicated to the
celebration of the marriage of Camacho the rich and the obsequies of
Basilio. Don Quixote would not enter the village, although the peasant
as well as the bachelor pressed him; he excused himself, however, on
the grounds, amply sufficient in his opinion, that it was the custom
of knights-errant to sleep in the fields and woods in preference to
towns, even were it under gilded ceilings; and so turned aside a
little out of the road, very much against Sancho's will, as the good
quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of Don Diego came back
to his mind. CHAPTER XX. WHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF
CAMACHO THE RICH, TOGETHER WITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POOR
CHAPTER XXI IN WHICH CAMACHO'S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER
DELIGHTFUL INCIDENTS While Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the
discussion set forth the last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a
great noise, which were uttered and made by the men on the mares as
they went at full gallop, shouting, to receive the bride and
bridegroom, who were approaching with musical instruments and
pageantry of all sorts around them, and accompanied by the priest and
the relatives of both, and all the most distinguished people of the
surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the bride, he exclaimed, "By my
faith, she is not dressed like a country girl, but like some fine
court lady; egad, as well as I can make out, the patena she wears rich
coral, and her green Cuenca stuff is thirty-pile velvet; and then the
white linen trimming--by my oath, but it's satin! Look at her
hands--jet rings on them! May I never have luck if they're not gold
rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as white as a curdled milk,
and every one of them worth an eye of one's head! Whoreson baggage,
what hair she has! if it's not a wig, I never saw longer or fairer all
the days of my life. See how bravely she bears herself--and her shape!
Wouldn't you say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters
of dates? for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look
just like them. I swear in my heart she is a brave lass, and fit 'to
pass over the banks of Flanders.'" Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's
boorish eulogies and thought that, saving his lady Dulcinea del
Toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful woman. The fair Quiteria
appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt, because of the bad night
brides always pass dressing themselves out for their wedding on the
morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood on one side of the
meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to plight their
troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and plays; but at
the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud outcry
behind them, and a voice exclaiming, "Wait a little, ye, as
inconsiderate as ye are hasty!" At these words all turned round, and
perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose
black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames. He was crowned
(as was presently seen) with a crown of gloomy cypress, and in his
hand he held a long staff. As he approached he was recognised by
everyone as the gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to see what
would come of his words, in dread of some catastrophe in consequence
of his appearance at such a moment. He came up at last weary and
breathless, and planting himself in front of the bridal pair, drove
his staff, which had a steel spike at the end, into the ground, and,
with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he thus addressed her in
a hoarse, trembling voice: "Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria,
that according to the holy law we acknowledge, so long as live thou
canst take no husband; nor art thou ignorant either that, in my hopes
that time and my own exertions would improve my fortunes, I have never
failed to observe the respect due to thy honour; but thou, casting
behind thee all thou owest to my true love, wouldst surrender what is
mine to another whose wealth serves to bring him not only good fortune
but supreme happiness; and now to complete it (not that I think he
deserves it, but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to bestow it upon him),
I will, with my own hands, do away with the obstacle that may
interfere with it, and remove myself from between you. Long live the
rich Camacho! many a happy year may he live with the ungrateful
Quiteria! and let the poor Basilio die, Basilio whose poverty clipped
the wings of his happiness, and brought him to the grave!" And so
saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, and leaving
one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that concealed a
tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt being planted
in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself upon
it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade
appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in
his blood, and transfixed by his own weapon. His friends at once ran
to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and sad fate, and Don
Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to support him, and took
him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased to breathe. They were
about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was standing by
objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him, as the
instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death. Basilio,
however, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain,
"If thou wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as my
bride in this last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness
would find pardon, as by its means I attained the bliss of being
thine." Hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his
soul rather than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness
implore God's pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which
Basilio replied that he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria
first gave him her hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose
his mind and give him courage to make his confession. Don Quixote
hearing the wounded man's entreaty, exclaimed aloud that what Basilio
asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that might be
easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Senor Camacho's
honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave Basilio
as if he received her direct from her father. "In this case," said he,
"it will be only to say 'yes,' and no consequences can follow the
utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be
the grave." Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and
bewildered and not knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the
entreaties of Basilio's friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to
give him her hand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair,
should not be lost, that they moved, nay, forced him, to say that if
Quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied, as it was only
putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all
assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers, and others with
tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor
Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue,
seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given
any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to
do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time
for hesitation. On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance
distressed, grieved, and repentant, advanced without a word to where
Basilio lay, his eyes already turned in his head, his breathing short
and painful, murmuring the name of Quiteria between his teeth, and
apparently about to die like a heathen and not like a Christian.
Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded his hand by signs
without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her,
said, "O Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when
thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for I have
not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me
in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly
drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of
thee, O thou fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me
and wouldst give me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me
afresh, but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint
upon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is
not meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this,
or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by
thee." While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the
bystanders expected each return of faintness would take his life with
it. Then Quiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her
right hand the hand of Basilio, said, "No force would bend my will; as
freely, therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the
hand of a lawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine
own free will, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act
has brought upon thee." "Yes, I give it," said Basilio, "not agitated
or distracted, but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to
grant me, thus do I give myself to be thy husband." "And I give myself
to be thy wife," said Quiteria, "whether thou livest many years, or
they carry thee from my arms to the grave." "For one so badly
wounded," observed Sancho at this point, "this young man has a great
deal to say; they should make him leave off billing and cooing, and
attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has it more on his tongue
than at his teeth." Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the
priest, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes; "it shall not be said
of me, master mine," he continued, "'the bread eaten and the company
dispersed.' Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all the world
knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom I am
descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by many
good words and deeds, your worship's desire to show me favour; and if
I have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to
please my wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammer
drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants;
but, after all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am
a man anyhow, which I can't deny, I will be one in my own house too,
let who will take it amiss; and so there's nothing more to do but for
your worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it
can't be provoked, and let us set out at once, to save Senor Samson's
soul from suffering, as he says his conscience obliges him to persuade
your worship to sally out upon the world a third time; so I offer
again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better
than all the squires that served knights-errant in times past or
present." The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard
Sancho's phraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the
first part of his master's history he never thought that he could be
so droll as he was there described; but now, hearing him talk of a
"will and codicil that could not be revoked," he believed all he had
read of him, and set him down as one of good blood; and it would be
strange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of virtue, and
those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation. There are
two roads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and honours;
one is that of letters, the other that of arms. I have more of arms
than of letters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to
arms, was born under the influence of the planet Mars. I am,
therefore, in a measure constrained to follow that road, and by it I
must travel in spite of all the world, and it will be labour in vain
for you to urge me to resist what heaven wills, fate ordains, reason
requires, and, above all, my own inclination favours; for knowing as I
do the countless toils that are the accompaniments of knight-errantry,
I know, too, the infinite blessings that are attained by it; I know
that the path of virtue is very narrow, and the road of vice broad and
spacious; I know their ends and goals are different, for the broad and
easy road of vice ends in death, and the narrow and toilsome one of
virtue in life, and not transitory life, but in that which has no end;
I know, as our great Castilian poet says, that-- It is by rugged paths
like these they go That scale the heights of immortality, Unreached by
those that falter here below." "Woe is me!" exclaimed the niece, "my
lord is a poet, too! He knows everything, and he can do everything; I
will bet, if he chose to turn mason, he could make a house as easily
as a cage." "I can tell you, niece," replied Don Quixote, "if these
chivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be
nothing that I could not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not
come from my hands, particularly cages and tooth-picks." At this
moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked who was
there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he. The instant the
housekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see
him; in such abhorrence did she hold him. The niece let him in, and
his master Don Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and
the pair shut themselves up in his room, where they had another
conversation not inferior to the previous one. CHAPTER VII. OF WHAT

PART II. TO THE COUNT OF LEMOS: These days past, when sending Your
Excellency my plays, that had appeared in print before being shown on
the stage, I said, if I remember well, that Don Quixote was putting on
his spurs to go and render homage to Your Excellency. Now I say that
"with his spurs, he is on his way." Should he reach destination
methinks I shall have rendered some service to Your Excellency, as
from many parts I am urged to send him off, so as to dispel the
loathing and disgust caused by another Don Quixote who, under the name
of Second Part, has run masquerading through the whole world. And he
who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great Emperor
of China, who wrote me a letter in Chinese a month ago and sent it by
a special courier. He asked me, or to be truthful, he begged me to
send him Don Quixote, for he intended to found a college where the
Spanish tongue would be taught, and it was his wish that the book to
be read should be the History of Don Quixote. He also added that I
should go and be the rector of this college. I asked the bearer if His
Majesty had afforded a sum in aid of my travel expenses. He answered,
"No, not even in thought." "Then, brother," I replied, "you can return
to your China, post haste or at whatever haste you are bound to go, as
I am not fit for so long a travel and, besides being ill, I am very
much without money, while Emperor for Emperor and Monarch for Monarch,
I have at Naples the great Count of Lemos, who, without so many petty
titles of colleges and rectorships, sustains me, protects me and does
me more favour than I can wish for." Thus I gave him his leave and I
beg mine from you, offering Your Excellency the "Trabajos de Persiles
y Sigismunda," a book I shall finish within four months, Deo volente,
and which will be either the worst or the best that has been composed
in our language, I mean of those intended for entertainment; at which
I repent of having called it the worst, for, in the opinion of
friends, it is bound to attain the summit of possible quality. May
Your Excellency return in such health that is wished you; Persiles
will be ready to kiss your hand and I your feet, being as I am, Your
Excellency's most humble servant. From Madrid, this last day of
October of the year one thousand six hundred and fifteen. At the
service of Your Excellency: MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA VOLUME II.
THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE God bless me, gentle (or it may be plebeian)
reader, how eagerly must thou be looking forward to this preface,
expecting to find there retaliation, scolding, and abuse against the
author of the second Don Quixote--I mean him who was, they say,
begotten at Tordesillas and born at Tarragona! Well then, the truth
is, I am not going to give thee that satisfaction; for, though
injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in mine the rule must admit
of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call him ass, fool, and
malapert, but I have no such intention; let his offence be his
punishment, with his bread let him eat it, and there's an end of it.
What I cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old
and one-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from
passing over me, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about
in some tavern, and not on the grandest occasion the past or present
has seen, or the future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty
to the beholder's eye, they are, at least, honourable in the
estimation of those who know where they were received; for the soldier
shows to greater advantage dead in battle than alive in flight; and so
strongly is this my feeling, that if now it were proposed to perform
an impossibility for me, I would rather have had my share in that
mighty action, than be free from my wounds this minute without having
been present at it. Those the soldier shows on his face and breast are
stars that direct others to the heaven of honour and ambition of
merited praise; and moreover it is to be observed that it is not with
grey hairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and that
commonly improves with years. I take it amiss, too, that he calls me
envious, and explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; for
really and truly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which
is holy, noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not
likely to attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he holds the
rank of familiar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on
account of him on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely
mistaken; for I worship the genius of that person, and admire his
works and his unceasing and strenuous industry. After all, I am
grateful to this gentleman, the author, for saying that my novels are
more satirical than exemplary, but that they are good; for they could
not be that unless there was a little of everything in them. I suspect
thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and keeping myself
too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a feeling that
additional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer, and that
what this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great, as he
does not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight, but
hides his name and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of
some lese majesty. If perchance thou shouldst come to know him, thou
shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary mouldering bones
of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him off, in opposition to
all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, making him rise from the
grave where in reality and truth he lies stretched at full length,
powerless to make any third expedition or new sally; for the two that
he has already made, so much to the enjoyment and approval of
everybody to whom they have become known, in this as well as in
foreign countries, are quite sufficient for the purpose of turning
into ridicule the whole of those made by the whole set of the
knights-errant; and so doing shalt thou discharge thy Christian
calling, giving good counsel to one that bears ill-will to thee. And I
shall remain satisfied, and proud to have been the first who has ever
enjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as he could desire; for my
desire has been no other than to deliver over to the detestation of
mankind the false and foolish tales of the books of chivalry, which,
thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now tottering, and
doubtless doomed to fall for ever. Farewell."
